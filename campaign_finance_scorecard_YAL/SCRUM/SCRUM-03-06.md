### What we have done this week
1. Collected all raw data from OCPF data regard with the keywords of Real Estate.
2. Collected all companies links from the [Sec of State website](http://corp.sec.state.ma.us/CorpWeb/CorpSearch/CorpSearch.aspx)
3. Downloaded nearly one sixth of annual report from the [Sec of State website](http://corp.sec.state.ma.us/CorpWeb/CorpSearch/CorpSearch.aspx) using the links collected in step 2
### Our plan for next week
1. Keep downloading the annual reports from the [Sec of State website](http://corp.sec.state.ma.us/CorpWeb/CorpSearch/CorpSearch.aspx)
2. Find a faster way to download the annual reports
### Problems we've encountered
1. The speed for downloading is too slow. We can only handel around 750 companies each hours, but there are over 440,000 companies.
