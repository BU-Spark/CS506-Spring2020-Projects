### Our plan for next week
1. Keep playing with scraper to get data from [Sec of State website](http://corp.sec.state.ma.us/CorpWeb/CorpSearch/CorpSearch.aspx)
2. Extract raw data from OCPF database
3. If have time, start analyzing law enforcement keywords
### Problems we've encountered
1. The [Sec of State website](http://corp.sec.state.ma.us/CorpWeb/CorpSearch/CorpSearch.aspx) is too hard to scrape. It's protected by an anti-scraping mechanism.
