# Scrum 4-3-20

By Guthrie Kuckes

Note that this week's scrum was delayed by the need to have a meeting with the client and a meeting with the full team in order to combat the lack of productivity of the past week. 

1. __What my team worked on:__
We met with the client and settled on a temporary solution to the duplicates problem. We also informally reran the search for informants cases in the neew data using pandas, and began to transition our codebase to use pandas since we agreed as a team that now that we are familiar with pandas after having learned it for the midterm, it is a good idea to do so. 

2.  __What work does the team plan to do next week?__
- We plan to rerun our analysis of which cases contain informants on the new data and write this up again as we did the first time. 
- We will investigate both a naive and a sophisticated approach (vectorizing the data) to figuring out which cases were overturned.  

3. __Is the team having any issues?__
We are currently catching up from being behind as a reesult of COVID19 and midterm-related disruption. We will not be able to meet with the client for the rest of the semester because of increases demands at his job due to COVID19 and we are unsure how to handle this.
