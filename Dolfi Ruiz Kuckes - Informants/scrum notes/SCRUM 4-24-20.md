# Scrum 4-24-20

By Guthrie Kuckes


1. __What my team worked on:__
-- We spent a considerable amount of time writing up deliverables 2/3 (combined this semester) as a team
- We continued tuning our method to decide which cases are overturned, creating a method which has greater coverage of all cases using more keywords and a decision tree like method (not the word2vec inspired method that we thought we were going to use last week)
- We called our legal contact several times to try to get answers to our legal questions, with no result
- We made pie charts for the cases overturned and not-overturned
- We manually found a few suspicious and non-suspicious cases that we can use to prime our word2vec model to find more (tech for this is complicated, see deliverables)

2.  __What work does the team plan to do next week?__
- We will be working on the final deliverable and presentation as a team
- We are going to use the current analysis of which cases are overturned to do logistic regression and figure out what words might be most important in this decision
- We will be improving our pie charts from the previous deliverable with the latest analysis of which cases are overturned
- We will continue improving the analysis of which cases are overturned by incorporating the insights from word2vec mentioned 2 weeks ago
- We will train word2vec on the manually found suspicious cases
- 


3. __Is the team having any issues?__
- The keywords that we thought we would use to establish a decision do not cover all the cases (they leave out like 1 in 5) and we are trying to figure out which keywords to use instead
- Processing punctuation in the decisions is throwing off our analysis in many cases--cases are preloaded with random punctuation between words
- Jupyter notebooks and .py files don't play nice together and in some cases this is creating errors--we are trying to solve this using ipython extensions
