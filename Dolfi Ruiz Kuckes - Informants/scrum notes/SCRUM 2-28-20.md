# Scrum 2-28-20

By Guthrie Kuckes
1. __What my team worked on:__
	We finished categorizing the full text of the court case decisions collected by previous groups as either containing informants or not, and wrote a report, which we shared with the client, about our results, with some manual analysis of a few individual cases.
	
2.  __What work does the team plan to do next week?__
- We plan to scrape the full text of court decisions from 2019 as well as from 2000-2008 from masscases.com, probably using selenium webdriver, in order to complement our current data. 
- We will also investigate how we will answer a big quesion for deliverable 2, which is categorizing cases as overturned or not

3. __Is the team having any issues?__
Coordination is going well at this point. Our only problem is interpreting the content of legal documents, but this has not seriously affected our work yet and we are reaching out to a law school faculty specializing in criminal law for help with this.
