# Scrum 4-17-20

By Guthrie Kuckes


1. __What my team worked on:__
- - We continued tuning our method to decide which cases are overturned, creating a method which gets a logical xor for lists of cases which contain certain keywords (right now in terms_in_cases.ipynb)
- We implemented a word2vec embedding system for all the cases 2000-2018 and used a method to figure out which words are used most similarly to "affirmed" and "reversed"--that is, these are the keywords that can be most effectively used in the future to tune the function which decides which cases are overturned (at this point, this is in vectorize.ipynb)
- We attempted to remove the dissents from the cases that contain them. We found out that relatively few cases contain dissents. We were unable to remove the dissents because of the issue of distinguishing the dissent from footnotes of the original case; however, we settled upon an algorithm for doing this at the team meeting. 


2.  __What work does the team plan to do next week?__
- We will be writing the combined deliverable 2/3 and presenting our results so far
- We will call a district attorney contact of ours to try to get answers to questions about the interpretability of our results given general reporting rules for cases in Massachussets
- We will make pie charts comparing the number of cases overturned for informant and non-informant cases. 
- We will manually find three suspicious and three non-suspicious informant cases in order to train a more sophisticated word2vec analysis. 
- We will continue to tune the function that decides whether cases are overturned using the word2vec results generated earlier 

3. __Is the team having any issues?__
- Our xor function for tuning the function that reveals which cases were overturned revealed that the function for deciding which cases were overturned was less accurate than we thought. We may need a more sophisticated method--for example, weighting keywords like "affirmed" more if they appear closer to the end of the decision.
