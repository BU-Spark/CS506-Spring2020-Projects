# Scrum 3-20-20

By Guthrie Kuckes
1. __What my team worked on:__
Work has been slow this week, howeveer, we reformatted the scraping script to scrape the cases we previously scraped (all 2000-2019) in a format more similar to that of the data scraped by previous groups. We also lookede at previous teams' efforts to determine which cases were overturned but we were having difficulty with their convulted code. We plan to talk much more about this at our team meeting on Sunday (we have not been able to meet this week because of caos caused by COVID-19)

2.  __What work does the team plan to do next week?__
  - We plan to rerun our analysis of which cases contain informants on the new data
 - We will continue to work on figuring out which cases were overturned, beginning by examining the algorithm used by previous teams
 - We will continue to talk to the client about the issue of duplicates between the appellate division of the district courts and the statewide appellate courts. 
 
3. __Is the team having any issues?__
We are currently in communication with spark, but Zeba has canceled our meetings for the next two weeks because of chaos caused by COVID-19 and this is slowing down work. We are also doing less work because several team members are occupied with moving out of their BU residence. 

As we were scraping new data to weeks ago, we realized that the data contained in the two separate JSONs left by previous teams, which we thought was homogenous, was not, but actually comes from two different parts of the court system. This complicates our analysis, and we will now have to do a sophisticated duplicate search--we are talking with the client but we have still not resolved what algorithm we are going to use in order to deal with possible issues.
