Search and Seizure, Motor vehicle, Threshold police inquiry, Reasonable suspicion. Threshold Police Inquiry. Firearms. Alcoholic Liquors, Possession of opened bottle. Beverage Containers.
A Superior Court judge erred in allowing the criminal defendants pretrial motion to suppress evidence seized from the motor vehicle he had been driving, where, at the moment of seizure, which occurred when a police officer activated his cruisers blue lights and blocked the egress of the defendants vehicle [345], the officer had minimally sufficient facts to establish a reasonable suspicion that the defendant was engaged in criminal activity, based on a report of the defendant holding a gun early in the morning on a deserted residential street from a witness whose basis of knowledge had been established, in combination with the defendants conduct and in light of the officers experience [345-347]; further, the officers actions were reasonably related in scope to the circumstances that justified the interference in the first place, and other police officers properly escalated their response in proportion to the defendants actions following the initial seizure that increased the degree of reasonable suspicion [347-349].","
The defendant, Joshua Edwards, has been indicted for multiple offenses, including firearms offenses, with which he was initially charged following the seizure and search of a motor vehicle he had been driving.  Before trial, he moved to suppress evidence seized during the search of the vehicle, invoking the
Page 342
Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.  After an evidentiary hearing, a Superior Court judge allowed the defendant's motion.  A single justice of this court allowed the Commonwealth leave to pursue an interlocutory appeal and reported the case to the Appeals Court.  See Mass. R. Crim. P. 15 (a) (2), as appearing in  422 Mass. 1501  (1996).  The Appeals Court reversed in an unpublished memorandum and order issued pursuant to its rule 1:28.  Commonwealth v. Edwards, 87 Mass. App. Ct. 1133  (2015).  We granted the defendant's application for further appellate review.  Recognizing that this is an exceedingly close case, we conclude that the stop was predicated on reasonable suspicion of criminal activity and therefore reverse the motion judge's order allowing the motion to suppress.
Factual background.  One witness, Boston police Officer David Lanteigne, testified at the hearing on the motion to suppress.  In addition, a number of photographs, documents, and police radio transmissions, as well as a recording of a 911 call, were received in evidence.  In reviewing a judge's decision on a motion to suppress, we ""accept the judge's subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error, but conduct an independent review of the judge's ultimate findings and conclusions of law.""  Commonwealth v. Washington,
, 480 (2007).  Without ""detract[ing] from the judge's ultimate findings,"" Commonwealth v. Jessup,
, 127-128 (2015), we supplement his factual findings with ""evidence from the record that 'is uncontroverted and undisputed and where the judge explicitly or implicitly credited the witness's testimony'"" (citation omitted).  Commonwealth v. Jones-Pannell,
, 431 (2015).

On March 17, 2013, at approximately 1:30 A.M., the Boston police received a 911 call.
The caller identified himself by name, Jabari Wattley, and told the operator that he could see a man
Page 343
standing in the street holding a gun.  Wattley further stated that he had seen the man drive off in a black Infiniti motor vehicle, return and park on Armandine Street (in the Dorchester section of Boston), get out of the vehicle holding a gun in his hand, and then get back into the vehicle.
He informed the operator that he knew the man, identified him as the defendant, Joshua Edwards, and said that Edwards was not threatening anyone.
The police dispatcher broadcast the information as a ""Priority 1"" call, requesting ""any unit nearby"" to respond to the address.  A call coded as ""Priority 1"" ""means that it was of a serious nature and that response time and protecting officer safety were both high priorities.""  A marked cruiser driven by Lanteigne arrived on Armandine Street shortly after the broadcast.
The cruiser did not have its emergency lights activated.  Lanteigne stopped when a man (later identified as Wattley) ran off his porch toward the cruiser and began ""yelling"" to Lanteigne and pointing at a black Acura motor vehicle that was parked twenty to thirty feet in front of the cruiser, on the right hand side of the street.

The Acura was legally parked very close to the curb, and was completely dark; no interior or external lights were on.  Another vehicle was parked in front of the Acura, but the space or spaces behind it were empty.  At that point, Lanteigne observed the Acura's brake lights illuminate, and Wattley yelled something to the effect of, ""That's him.  That's the guy, he's about to drive away.""  In response, Lanteigne activated the cruiser's blue lights, strobe lights, and other lights, and moved the cruiser alongside the driver's side of the Acura in order to block the vehicle from
Page 344
leaving.  Lanteigne believed ""the Acura was about to drive away . . . [and] understood that the person Wattley had seen with a handgun was driving the Acura.""
Lanteigne got out of the cruiser and removed his firearm from its holster.  At the same time, the defendant got out of the Acura and closed the door.  He ""appeared to take no notice of and pay no attention to"" Lanteigne, and started to walk away.  Lanteigne responded by running to the front of his cruiser and ordering the defendant to stop.  When the defendant turned and started walking away quickly, the officer holstered his own weapon, pushed the defendant against the rear of the Acura, forced him to the ground when he resisted being pushed, and handcuffed him.
Another police officer who had responded to the scene stood immediately next to the closed driver's side door of the Acura, and leaned toward the window.  He observed a firearm lying on the floor by the driver's seat.
If the defendant had been seated in the vehicle, ""his legs would have completely hidden the gun from view.""
The police determined that the defendant did not have a Massachusetts driver's license, and that he was not the registered owner of the Acura.  The police decided to tow the vehicle because a person having lawful control of the vehicle was not present, and because there had been vandalism in the area.  Prior to the tow, the vehicle was searched pursuant to an inventory policy.  In addition to the firearm, the police found an open bottle of beer, a cup containing what appeared to be an alcoholic beverage in the console next to the driver's seat, and a closed, full bottle of beer.
Suppression ruling.  The motion judge allowed the motion to suppress because he concluded that, at the time Lanteigne stopped and seized the Acura vehicle -- identified by the judge as the moment when Lanteigne activated his cruiser's blue lights and blocked the Acura from leaving -- the police lacked a reasonable, articulable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot.
See Commonwealth v. Alvarado,
, 268 & n.3 (1996), citing Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968).  The judge emphasized that it is not unlawful to carry a gun in public; it is only
Page 345
illegal to do so without a license.  The judge concluded that a report of a man holding an unholstered gun on a public sidewalk, late at night in a high crime area, was not sufficiently suspicious to warrant an investigatory stop.  He therefore ordered that the evidence discovered in the vehicle be suppressed.
Discussion.  We agree with the motion judge that the determinative issue in this case is whether the initial stop of the Acura was predicated on ""reasonable suspicion, based on specific, articulable facts and reasonable inferences therefrom, that an occupant  of the . . . motor vehicle had committed, was committing, or was about to commit a crime.""  Alvarado, 426 Mass. at 268.  See Commonwealth v. Wilson,
, 394 (2004).  See also Terry, 392 U.S. at 21-22.
Breaking down the inquiry into its component parts, we consider when the stop and seizure occurred, whether the stop was supported by reasonable suspicion, and whether the scope of the ensuing search was proportional to the degree of suspicion that prompted it.
1.  Moment of seizure.  Like the motion judge, we conclude that the defendant clearly was stopped and seized in the constitutional sense when Lanteigne activated his cruiser's blue lights and blocked the Acura's egress.  See Commonwealth v. Thompson,
, 733, cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1008 (1998).  Viewed objectively, at that moment, a reasonable person would not have believed that he was free to leave the scene.  See Commonwealth v. Barros,
, 173-174 (2001); Commonwealth v. Smigliano,
, 491 (1998).
2.  Reasonable suspicion to initiate stop.  Under the principles of Terry, 392 U.S. at 21-22, a police officer may stop a person to make a ""threshold inquiry where suspicious conduct gives the officer reason to suspect that a person has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime.""  Commonwealth v. Silva,
, 405 (1974).  An officer's suspicion must be grounded in ""'specific, articulable facts and reasonable inferences [drawn] therefrom' rather than on a 'hunch'"" (citation omitted).  Commonwealth v. Lyons,
, 19 (1990).  In this case, the stop was predicated primarily on the information contained in the police broadcast.  That information was provided by a person who both identified himself and said he personally had seen the defendant with a gun at 1:30 A.M. on a deserted, residential street.  He identified the defendant by name; explained that he knew the defendant; met the police officer, Lanteigne, at the address he had provided to the 911 dispatcher; and pointed out the defendant's
Page 346
vehicle to Lanteigne.
In these circumstances, Wattley's basis of knowledge was established, and his report of seeing the defendant holding a firearm ""could be regarded as reliable without any prior demonstration of his reliability.""  Commonwealth v. Gouse,
, 793 (2012), quoting Commonwealth v. Bowden,
, 477 (1980) (distinguishing reports of anonymous informants from those of ""bystanders, victims and participants"").
Although Wattley did not describe the firearm to the 911 dispatcher -- and, as the motion judge observed, there is nothing illegal about merely possessing an appropriately licensed gun -- there was more to the 911 call and Wattley's description of the defendant's behavior than mere possession of a gun.
As Wattley reported, the defendant drove away and then came back to Armandine Street; he got out of the vehicle and stood outside while holding a gun -- apparently in his open hand, because Wattley reported seeing the weapon; the defendant returned the firearm to the vehicle before entering the vehicle himself; and he then sat alone in the vehicle with all of its lights off.  These facts, coupled with the time (approximately 1:30 A.M.), the location (a deserted street in a residential area, ""within a few blocks"" of which there had been repeated crimes of violence, including gun violence and homicides), and the officer's belief that ""trained, licensed owners of a handgun typically carry their firearm in a holster,""
combine to create a scenario that an experienced police officer could reasonably believe is more consistent with likely
Page 347
criminal activity than it is with lawful possession of a firearm.  Although, unlike Commonwealth v. Haskell,
, 791, 794 (2003), the defendant was not observed loading the gun, the facts just described concerning the time of night, the location, and the defendant's conduct in driving away and returning and, more particularly, in his handling of the gun as he got out of and then reentered the Acura, were collectively significant.
When these facts are considered together and in light of Lanteigne's police experience, they are sufficient to establish, even if just barely, the requisite nexus to suspected criminal activity to warrant an investigatory stop, because the officer ""could reasonably infer from the conjunction of these facts that criminal activity might be afoot.""  Thompson, 427 Mass. at 734.  See id. (vehicle double-parked in front of townhouse that was subject of narcotics investigation, late at night, with engine running, in high crime area); Commonwealth v. Almeida,
, 271-272 (1977) (reasonable suspicion present where defendant was sitting alone in automobile in high crime area late at night, with its engine running and lights off).
Contrast Couture, 407 Mass. at 183 (in absence of other factors, ""mere possession of a handgun was not sufficient to give rise to a reasonable suspicion that the defendant was illegally carrying that gun"").
3.  Scope of search.  Not only was the decision to make an investigatory stop objectively reasonable, but the officer's actions were ""reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.""  Commonwealth v. Borges,
, 793 (1985), quoting Terry, 392 U.S. at 20.  See Commonwealth v. Moses,
, 141 (1990) (once investigative circumstances for stop are established, ""[t]he pertinent inquiry is whether the degree of intrusion is reasonable in the circumstances"").  When Lanteigne saw the Acura's brake lights illuminate, he ""feared that the Acura was about to drive away.""  Activating the cruiser's emergency lights and blocking the Acura's egress were reasonably prudent protective measures that were proportional to the degree of suspicion that prompted the stop.  See Moses, supra (""common knowledge that a person who wants to avoid police questioning, very often will recklessly drive away, resulting in serious injury to the police and bystanders"").
Page 348
The defendant's actions following the initial seizure of the Acura increased the degree of reasonable suspicion, and the police response properly escalated in proportion to it.  See Commonwealth v. Sinforoso,
, 323 (2001) (""conduct of the officers was proportional to the escalating suspicion that emerged over the course of the stop"").  See also Haskell, 438 Mass. at 794.  At the time of the stop, Lanteigne was alone, very late at night, on a deserted street in an area that he knew from his police experience had been the site of repeated incidents involving the use of guns as well as homicides and other violent crimes.  He was aware of Wattley's report that the defendant was armed, that he had left the scene and then returned, and that he had held the weapon openly on the residential street before concealing its presence by returning it to the vehicle.  Those facts properly were ""considered as part of the aggregate circumstances that provide reasonable suspicion to justify a protective frisk.""  Commonwealth v. Gomes,
, 512 (2009).  See Wilson, 441 Mass. at 394-395.  See also Sinforoso, supra at 325.  If the defendant had remained seated in the vehicle, the officer would have been warranted in ordering him from the vehicle to conduct that patfrisk.  See Commonwealth v. Robbins,
, 151 (1990) (protective measures may include protective frisk and minimal search of interior of vehicle).
The defendant did not, however, remain in the vehicle.  Instead, after the cruiser's blue lights and strobe lights had been activated and the cruiser had pulled along the driver's side of the Acura, the defendant get out of the vehicle and ""appeared to take no notice of and pay no attention to Lanteigne and started to walk away; he disregarded the officer's order to stop, and turned and began to walk quickly in a different direction.  Because the defendant resisted the officer's attempts to stop him, the officer was warranted in physically restraining him to further the investigation.  See Commonwealth v. Williams,
, 119 (1996) (""restraint, . . . limited in duration and necessary to complete the [investigatory] inquiry, does not turn a valid investigatory stop into an unlawful arrest"").  See also Commonwealth v. Torres,
, 162 (1997) (limited restraint for purposes of threshold inquiry permissible where commensurate with purpose of stop).
While Lanteigne was occupied with the defendant, another officer, who had arrived on the scene and was standing outside the defendant's vehicle, observed a gun on the floor of the Acura near the driver's seat.  For essentially the same reason that Lanteigne
Page 349
was justified in frisking the defendant, and in light of the defendant's actions after the initial stop, the police were entitled to determine ""whether the object was, in fact, a weapon which could be used against them.  The [officers] were not required to gamble with their personal safety.""  Robbins, 407 Mass. at 152.  See Sinforoso, 434 Mass. at 324 (actions of police officers in entering automobile to retrieve discovered weapons was reasonable for officer safety); Silva, 366 Mass. at 408 (""a Terry type of search may extend into the interior of an automobile so long as it is limited in scope to a protective end"").  Although the defendant was not in the vehicle at the time the gun was observed, ""like the defendant in Silva, [supra,] he was not under arrest at the time of the 'pat-down' search of his person, and there was no assurance that he would not be returning promptly to his seat behind the wheel of the automobile.""  Almeida, 373 Mass. at 272.  In the circumstances, the police intrusion into the vehicle was reasonably justified in scope.
Once the police lawfully had access to the vehicle, under the plain view doctrine, additional items could be seized, provided the incriminating character was apparent.  See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Santana,
, 211 (1995).  In this case, two open containers of what appeared to be alcoholic beverages were seized from the center console.  The incriminating character of these open containers was apparent.  See Commonwealth v. Johnson,
, 50 n.7 (2011) (""possession of an open container of alcohol in a motor vehicle is a misdemeanor""); G. L. c. 90, § 24I (open container law).
We conclude that seizure of the items contained in the vehicle was constitutionally permissible.

Conclusion.  Considered collectively, the articulable facts in this case combine to establish a reasonable suspicion of criminal
Page 350
activity before the defendant was stopped and seized, albeit with the very narrowest of margins.  Objectively, the police officer could consider the behavior reported, the weapon identified, the time of night, and the characteristics of the location, and reasonably suspect that the sum of these activities equated to criminality.  The order allowing the motion to suppress is vacated, and a new order is to be entered denying the motion.  The case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

At a murder trial, in which the Commonwealth proceeded on mutually exclusive theories of joint venture but in which there was no codefendant on whose actions the defendant's conviction relied, the evidence was sufficient to permit the jury reasonably to find that the defendant knowingly had participated in the premeditated murder with the requisite intent. [664-667]
At a murder trial, the judge did not err in admitting in evidence the testimony of a police detective regarding gangs, where the detective's extensive experience with gangs generally, and with the victim and defendant specifically, qualified him as an expert and provided direct personal knowledge for the testimony he offered; and where the judge took precautions to minimize any prejudicial impact of the gang opinion testimony. [667-669]
At a criminal trial, no error arose in the prosecutor's opening statement, where the prosecutor's statements regarding the jury's view of the crime scene were merely enthusiastic rhetoric and were not evidence; similarly, no error arose in the prosecutor's closing argument, where the challenged statements either were proper or fell within the category of permissible rhetoric. [669-671]
At a murder trial, the judge did not err or abuse her discretion in admitting in evidence statements from certain witnesses, where the statements were not admitted for their truth and thus were not hearsay [671-672]; further, the judge did not err in admitting statements from the victim's girl friend, where the statements met both of the criteria of spontaneous utterances and supported the Commonwealth's theory that the murder was motivated by an ongoing feud between gangs [672-673]; finally, the judge did not err in permitting a police detective to testify regarding a discrepancy between a bar's video surveillance footage and the defendant's global positioning system data, where the detective's testimony properly assisted the jury in evaluating the evidence and understanding the time discrepancy [673-674].
There was no merit to the defendant's claim that his counsel at a murder trial was ineffective for failing to direct the jury's attention to certain pieces of evidence or to seek their admission, where the defendant failed to demonstrate that these alleged failures likely influenced the jury's verdict. [674-675]
Page 659
A Superior Court judge did not err in denying the criminal defendant's motion to dismiss the indictments against him, where the Commonwealth presented to the grand jury sufficient evidence to sustain an indictment for murder in the first degree as part of a joint venture. [675-676]","
On February 23, 2012, Anthony Depina was shot and killed outside a bar in the Roxbury section of Boston.  The defendant, Jason Barbosa, was indicted on the charges of murder in the first degree and unlawful possession of a firearm as an armed career criminal
.  The Commonwealth proceeded against him on the theory of deliberate premeditation.  Specifically, the Commonwealth's theory at trial was that the shooting was committed as part of a joint venture wherein the defendant was a knowing participant, either as the shooter or as an accomplice.  The jury convicted the defendant of murder in the first degree, and did not specify whether they found the defendant guilty as a principal or as a joint venturer.
On appeal, the defendant argues that (1) the Commonwealth presented insufficient evidence to support his conviction as both the shooter and as a knowing participant with shared intent to kill; (2) the judge abused her discretion in admitting prejudicial gang evidence; (3) the prosecutor's opening statement and closing argument were improper; (4) the judge allowed inadmissible statements, which unfairly bolstered the Commonwealth's theory of gang retaliation and allowed improper interpretive testimony; (5) trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel; and (6) the motion judge erroneously denied the defendant's motion to dismiss the indictments.  We affirm the conviction and decline to grant relief pursuant to G. L. c. 278, § 33E.
Background.  We recite the relevant facts the jury could have found.  We reserve certain details of the evidence presented to the grand jury for later discussion of the defendant's motion to dismiss.
Page 660
The defendant and the victim had ties to rival Cape Verdean gangs.  The defendant was a member of the Woodward Avenue gang, and the victim was associated with the Wendover Street gang.  Although the groups were aligned at one point, around 2005, the relationship between them deteriorated and they became involved in an ongoing feud active through February, 2012, when the victim was murdered.
On December 24, 2011, the defendant and two other members of the Woodward Avenue gang, Kenneth Lopes and Manuel Montrond, were involved in an altercation with several members of the Wendover Street gang, including the gang's leader, at a gasoline station in Boston.  The defendant and Lopes were injured during the altercation, but neither cooperated with the police investigation.
Two months later, on February 23, 2012, around 9:30 p.m., the defendant, who was on probation and wearing a global positioning system (GPS) tracking bracelet, and Montrond arrived at a bar near the intersection of Burrell Street and Norfolk Avenue in Roxbury in a black Cadillac CTS rented by Montrond.  Minutes later, Lopes alighted from a different vehicle.  Montrond signaled Lopes by flashing his headlights twice.  The three men entered the bar.
The actions of the defendant, Montrond, and Lopes were captured by the bar's eleven video surveillance cameras.  The cameras inside the bar were continuously recording, while the cameras outside the bar were motion-activated.  Analysis of the time stamp on the video surveillance and the defendant's GPS data
revealed that the time stamp on the video recordings was approximately four minutes and thirty seconds fast.  Other actions that were relevant were tracked by the coordinates of the GPS and involved streets that were near the bar.
Once inside the bar, the men socialized with the defendant's ex-girl friend, and her cousin.  A few minutes after the men arrived, Montrond left the bar and went outside to sit in the Cadillac.  The victim walked by and waved at Montrond on his way into the bar.
Page 661
Although the bar is located in territory claimed by Woodward Avenue gang members, members of the Wendover Street gang, including the victim, also patronized the bar.  The defendant and the victim grew up together and were friends when they were younger, but their relationship changed when the defendant, who had been affiliated with the Wendover Street gang, began to associate with members of the Woodward Avenue gang.  Despite the change in their relationship, when the victim arrived at the bar just before 10 p.m. with Maria Teixeira, the victim greeted the defendant with a handshake and then walked to the end of the bar.
The defendant and the victim each left the bar at different times and returned without incident, including when the defendant was in Montrond's vehicle while the victim walked by.
At one point, however, the defendant left the bar and drove around, returning to the area of the bar at around 10:20 p.m., and then drove to Woodward Avenue.  The defendant returned to Burrell Street and walked toward the bar.  The victim and Teixeira left the bar just before 10:30 p.m. and stopped by the victim's home before leaving again.  Meanwhile, the defendant appeared to be searching the area; he walked down Burrell Street, where the victim's vehicle had been parked, and then turned around, returning to his vehicle and driving to Albion Street, where Teixeira lived.  At around 10:45 p.m., the defendant returned to the area of Burrell Street and Norfolk Avenue, followed by Montrond's rented black Cadillac.  The defendant alighted from a small, dark-colored sport utility vehicle (SUV) and went inside the bar.  A black Cadillac followed the vehicle the defendant had been in.  Once inside the bar, the defendant looked around the interior of the establishment, searching the bar area, pool room, lounge, and bathroom before leaving less than a minute after arriving.
At around 11 p.m., the victim and Teixeira returned to the area of Burrell Street and Norfolk Avenue near the bar.  The victim previously had made plans with Joseph Rosa, a member of the Wendover Street gang, and two women to meet at the bar for drinks.  The victim and Teixeira arrived in the victim's vehicle and parked on Burrell Street, with the driver's side of the vehicle next to the sidewalk, near a dark alley.  Although the plan was to go have drinks at the bar, the people the victim was meeting decided not to go inside.  Instead, the victim and Teixeira walked over to Rosa's vehicle and spoke with the occupants through the passenger-side window while standing on the sidewalk.  While the group
Page 662
was talking, the defendant pulled up driving a small black SUV, and stopped alongside Rosa's vehicle.  The defendant said something to the effect of, ""You don't belong here.""   The victim said something back to the defendant, and the defendant quickly drove away, followed by the black Cadillac.
As a result of the interaction with the defendant, Rosa and one of the women encouraged the victim to leave, but he refused, insisting that he was a ""tough kid"" and that no one could tell him where he can go.  Rosa and the two women left.  The victim and Teixeira went back to the bar, intending to have a drink.  Teixeira went inside the bar to use the bathroom; the victim stayed outside and smoked a cigarette.  The defendant drove past the bar slowly in the small black SUV.  As the defendant drove by, the victim stood by the front door of the bar and pointed at the defendant.
Seconds later, the victim went inside the bar; he first went to the bathroom and then waited for Teixeira at the bar, declining a drink.  When Teixeira joined him at the bar, he told her that he had changed his mind and wanted to leave.  The victim did not tell Teixeira why he had changed his mind and appeared normal, but a little ""mad.""  As the victim and Teixeira left the bar and walked to his vehicle, they had a conversation about the earlier interaction with the defendant at Rosa's vehicle.  As Teixeira and the victim approached his vehicle, headlights from a vehicle up the street flashed four times.  The victim looked toward the street.  Teixeira heard him use the defendant's nickname and say, ""Are you for real, Little J?""  Teixeira looked down the street and saw an individual walking in the middle of the street, but she could not see the individual's face.
Immediately thereafter, another individual fired multiple gunshots at the victim from the nearby alley.
The victim was shot in the head and torso, and he fell to the ground, face up, in between the driver's side door of his vehicle and the curb.
At or about the time of the shooting, which was approximately 11:10:43 p.m., the defendant's GPS data points
established that at 11:10:05 p.m., he was located on Burrell Street, near Batchelder
Page 663
Street, traveling zero miles per hour.  At 11:10:36 p.m., the defendant was on Burrell Street headed toward Norfolk Avenue, near the bar, traveling two miles per hour.  There was a missing data point directly after the murder, which should have recorded at 11:11:06 p.m.  Seconds after the shooting, the dark-colored SUV drove down Burrell Street, turned right on Norfolk Avenue, and then took another right onto Marshfield Street.
At that time, 11:11:35 p.m., the defendant's GPS coordinates show him traveling on Marshfield Street at thirty-eight miles per hour.  Minutes after the shooting, the defendant returned to a house on Woodward Avenue.

After Teixeira heard the gunshots, she ran across the street and back inside the bar.  Although Teixeira saw the victim go down, she did not realize he had been shot when she fled the gunfire.  As she re-entered the bar, Teixeira kept saying ""shots fired, shots fired.""  Eventually, she went back outside to discover the victim's body, lying face-up between his vehicle and the curb.  The bartender telephoned 911.
When police officers arrived at around 11:15 p.m., Teixeira was hysterical.  Officers had to physically restrain her as well as hold her upright because she was distraught, screaming, and crying.  She was transported to Boston police headquarters.  On the way, she stated, ""They're going to kill me for this.""  In the interview room at the police station, she was still so emotionally upset that she became physically ill.  Shortly thereafter, she was asked some questions.  She stated, ""These people want to kill people because of the fucking street.""  After she identified the victim, Teixeira announced, ""I'm going to die for this.  I'm going to tell you anyway.""  In response to the detective's question ""Who shot?,"" Teixeira replied, ""Little J, Jason.""
The victim suffered gunshots wounds to the head and torso, both of which were independently fatal and caused his death within seconds.  Although ballistics evidence was recovered from the victim's body and the crime scene, analysis was inconclusive as to whether the bullet fragments were fired from the same weapon.
Page 664
The shell casings were identified as nine millimeter Lugar caliber and were fired from the same semiautomatic pistol.  No firearm was recovered in connection with the victim's shooting.
As part of the investigation, detectives sought to identify and locate the Cadillac that Montrond had rented and the small black SUV the defendant was driving on the night of the shooting.  The small black SUV was never located.  Although the rental contract on the Cadillac was set to end on February 29, 2012, Montrond returned the vehicle the day after the shooting, canceled the contract, and established a new rental contract for a 2012 Buick Lacrosse.

Two days after the shooting, the defendant and Montrond were stopped by police, who seized the defendant's cellular telephone.  Pursuant to a search warrant, detectives searched the defendant's cellular telephone and telephone records.  The telephone records established that approximately two minutes before the shooting, the defendant telephoned one of the leaders of the Woodward Avenue gang, and that approximately one minute after the shooting, at 11:12 p.m., the defendant made a telephone call to another leader of the Woodward Avenue gang.   Between 11:13 p.m. and 11:20 p.m., the defendant received a telephone call from Lopes, made an outgoing call to Montrond, and received another incoming call from Lopes.
The defendant moved for a required finding of not guilty at the close of the Commonwealth's case, which was denied.  The judge also denied the defendant's renewed motion for a required finding of not guilty at the close of all evidence.
Discussion.  1.  Sufficiency of the evidence.  The defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence for his conviction.  Specifically, he argues that because the jury returned a general verdict, and the Commonwealth proceeded on mutually exclusive theories of joint venture liability, his conviction must be reversed where the Commonwealth failed to present sufficient evidence to prove that he was both the shooter and a knowing participant with the shared intent to kill, beyond a reasonable doubt.  In support of his argument, the defendant's relies on Commonwealth v. Akara,

, 254-256 (2013), for the proposition that where the Commonwealth proceeds on mutually exclusive theories of joint venture, it must prove the sufficiency of the evidence as to each theory.  We disagree.
The rule we apply in analyzing the sufficiency of the evidence was articulated in Commonwealth v. Zanetti,
, 468 (2009):
""we will examine whether the evidence is sufficient to permit a rational juror to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knowingly participated in the commission of the crime charged, with the intent required to commit the crime, rather than examine the sufficiency of the evidence separately as to principal and joint venture liability.""
As we noted in Akara, 465 Mass. at 254, the circumstances of that case were ""unusual,"" such that we departed from our traditional analysis under Zanetti, supra.  In Akara, supra at 254-255, two defendants were tried jointly, but the evidence presented did not support the conclusion that both defendants could have fired the weapon.  Paradoxically, the strongest evidence against each defendant was that he knowingly participated in the charged crime by pulling the trigger.  Id. at 254.  Given the unique factual circumstances of the case, this court considered ""whether the evidence, . . . in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, support[ed] the conclusion that each defendant, although not the shooter, participated in and shared the requisite intent to commit the crime"" to ensure that each conviction was legally supportable.  Id.
This case, however, does not call for such a departure from Zanetti.  Although the defendant correctly notes that here, as in Akara, the Commonwealth proceeded on mutually exclusive theories of joint venture (e.g., the defendant as the shooter and as a coventurer), there was no codefendant upon whose actions the defendant's conviction relies.  See Akara, 465 Mass. at 254.  Thus, the Commonwealth's burden here is to demonstrate that the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, supported the conclusion that the defendant ""knowingly participated in the commission of the crime charged, alone or with others, with the intent required for that offense,"" Zanetti, 454 Mass. at 468, rather than prove each ""theory"" separately.
""In order to have committed murder in the first degree with deliberate premeditation, a defendant must have had or shared an
Page 666
'intent to kill or cause death,' [Commonwealth v. Norris,
, 139 (2012)], which was the 'product of ""cool reflection.""'""  Commonwealth v. Tavares,
, 434-435 (2015), quoting Zanetti, 454 Mass. at 455.  ""In evaluating whether the evidence at trial was sufficient to support these elements, we 'view the evidence presented in the Commonwealth's case-in-chief in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and ask whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.'""  Commonwealth v. Gonzalez,
, 407 (2016), quoting Commonwealth v. Simpkins,
, 461 (2015).  ""[C]ircumstantial evidence is sufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt[, and t]o the extent that conflicting inferences may be drawn from the evidence, it is for the jury to decide which version to credit"" (citation omitted).  Commonwealth v. Miranda,
, 113 (2010), cert. denied, 565 U.S. 1013 (2011), S.C.,
(2016).
From the evidence, a reasonable jury could have found that the defendant was motivated by anger at the ongoing feud between the Woodward Avenue gang and the Wendover Street gang, especially after the altercation at the gasoline station between the defendant, Lopes, and Montrond, and members of the Wendover Street gang, which occurred two months prior to the murder, resulted in the injury to the defendant and Lopes.  The jury also could have found that the defendant's threat, ""You don't belong here,"" was evidence of his motivation to kill because the victim, an associate of the Wendover Street gang, was present in Woodward Avenue gang ""territory.""
Based on the surveillance footage from the interior and exterior of the bar and the defendant's GPS data, the jury also could have found that after the defendant left the bar the first time, he began stalking the victim, thus demonstrating his knowing participation and shared intent to commit the premeditated murder.  See Zanetti, 454 Mass. at 455.  Specifically, the defendant traveled to the area near the bar around 10:20 p.m., before returning to Woodward Avenue.  Approximately ten minutes later, after the victim and Teixeira left the bar, the defendant walked to Burrell Street where the victim had been parked and then turned around.  Thereafter, the defendant drove to Albion Street, where Teixeira lived, and later returned to the bar and searched for the victim at 10:45 p.m.  At around 11 p.m., the defendant threatened the victim, stating, ""You don't belong here,"" and approximately eight minutes later, he slowly drove by the bar where the victim was smoking a
Page 667
cigarette outside.  This interaction made the victim change his plan of getting a drink at the bar, and instead he insisted that he and Teixeira leave the bar.  Finally, a vehicle's headlights flashed four times signaling the victim's arrival at his vehicle.
The inference of the defendant's participation in the joint venture is even stronger based on the victim's statement as he approached his vehicle, ""Are you for real, Little J?,"" and Teixeira's observation of a man in the middle of the street with short braided hair, which matched the description of the defendant.  Also, the defendant's GPS data places him walking on Burrell Street, near the victim's vehicle, at or about the time of the murder.  Seconds later, gunshots rang out from the alley, killing the victim.
The defendant's flight from the scene less than a minute after the shooting, traveling thirty-eight miles per hour on Marshfield Street and eventually arriving on Woodward Avenue, and telephone calls with his suspected coventurers immediately before the shooting and in the thirty minutes after, allow the reasonable inference of the defendant's participation in and shared intent to commit the murder.  See Miranda, 458 Mass. at 113; Zanetti, 454 Mass. at 455.
Therefore, the jury could reasonably have found that the defendant knowingly participated in the premeditated murder, with the requisite shared intent.  See Zanetti, supra at 468.
2.  Gang opinion testimony.  The judge conducted a voir dire to assess -- and to allow the defendant to challenge -- the foundation for the opinions of the Commonwealth's gang expert, Detective Martin O'Malley.  At trial, the jury heard about O'Malley's background and experience with Cape Verdean gangs.  The defendant contends that the judge abused her discretion in allowing this testimony, both because O'Malley was not qualified and because his testimony was based on inadmissible hearsay.  The Commonwealth argues that the evidence was properly admitted to prove motive, and was based on the qualified expert's personal knowledge.  There was no error.
Expert opinion testimony ""must rest on a proper basis, else inadmissible evidence might enter in the guise of expert opinion.""  Commonwealth v. Waite,
, 803 (1996). Proper bases include facts within the witness's direct personal knowledge, or unadmitted but independently admissible evidence.  See Mass. G. Evid. § 703 (2017); Department of Youth Servs. v. A Juvenile,
, 531 (1986).  Here, O'Malley's extensive experience
Page 668
with Cape Verdean gangs generally, and with the victim and defendant specifically, qualified him as an expert and provided direct personal knowledge for the testimony he offered.  O'Malley served as lead investigator from the Boston police department in an approximately two-year joint investigation with the Federal Bureau of Investigation into Woodward Avenue gang members, which concluded in January, 2013.  Before that, he was a patrolman in the Dorchester section of Boston for seven years, and assigned to the youth violence strike force gang unit for another two.  In both capacities, O'Malley logged countless conversations with Cape Verdean residents -- including concerned citizens, cultivated informants, and admitted gang members -- and from these interactions, he made determinations of gang affiliation.  He testified to individual affiliations within the Woodward Avenue and Wendover Street gangs; to the territorial reach of each gang; and to the history of the gangs as aligned until about 2005, when a split gave rise to a feud active at the time of the victim's death.  O'Malley knew the victim since about 2005, and had observed him with Wendover Street gang associates and at the addresses of the gang's headquarters on several occasions.  He was similarly familiar with the defendant, whom he had observed wearing Woodward Avenue gang colors and in the presence of Woodward Avenue gang leaders on multiple occasions.  O'Malley also testified that the defendant had left the Wendover Street gang for the Woodward Avenue gang in 2006 and that, as a result, animosity remained between the defendant and a leader of the Wendover Street gang.
O'Malley's testimony, based on his personal knowledge, was admissible.  Mass. G. Evid. § 703.  See Commonwealth v. Smith,
, 399, cert. denied, 555 U.S. 893 (2008) (rejecting hearsay challenge to officer's gang opinion testimony based on ""use of informants, street sources of information, the school police, teachers, probation officers, enemies,"" where officer had personal familiarity with victim, defendant, and their respective gangs).
The Commonwealth's theory was that there was a joint venture motivated by this ongoing rivalry between the Woodward Avenue and Wendover Street gangs.  Evidence of the defendant's affiliation with the Woodward Avenue gang was probative of motive, and provided necessary context for the defendant's statement to the victim (""You don't belong here"").  See Commonwealth v. Correa,
, 201 (2002) (""[W]here evidence of gang affiliation is relevant to the defendant's motive, it is within the
Page 669
discretion of the judge to weigh the probative value of the evidence against its prejudicial effect"").
Moreover, the judge took precautions to minimize any prejudicial impact of the gang opinion testimony.  She conducted individual voir dire with each juror, using three agreed-upon questions to confirm the juror's capacity to consider the evidence only for its limited purpose.  Each time the evidence was introduced, it was accompanied by a thorough limiting instruction, which was repeated in the final charge.  Especially where the judge carefully cabined properly admitted testimony with limiting instructions, voir dire, and exclusion of any references to prior acts of gang-related violence, admitting that testimony in evidence was not an error.  See Smith, 450 Mass. at 400, and cases cited.
3.  Prosecutor's opening statement and closing argument.  The defendant argues that the prosecutor's opening statement and closing argument, to which the defendant did not object, were improper.  ""Although not dispositive, we consider the fact that the defendant did not object to the statements at trial as 'some indication that the tone [and] manner . . . of the now challenged aspects of the prosecutor's argument were not unfairly prejudicial.'""  Commonwealth v. Lyons,
, 471 (1998), quoting Commonwealth v. Mello,
, 380 (1995).  We conclude that there was no error.
""The proper function of an opening is to outline in a general way the nature of the case which the counsel expects to be able to prove or support by evidence.""  Commonwealth v. Croken,
, 268 (2000), quoting Commonwealth v. Fazio,
, 454 (1978).  ""[A] claim of improper [opening statement] by the prosecutor must be judged in light of the entire [statement], the judge's instructions to the jury, and the evidence actually introduced at trial.""  Commonwealth v. Jones,
, 260-261 (2003), quoting Commonwealth v. Thomas,
, 158 (1999).  Here, the defendant argues that the prosecutor improperly appealed to the jury's emotions by reminding them that they saw where the shooter emerged from the alley during the view of the crime scene, and by using phrases such as ""killing team"" and ""stalking and hunting,"" during his opening statement.  The prosecutor's statements were not improper, as they were merely ""enthusiastic rhetoric.""  See Commonwealth v. Simpson,
, 586 (2001).  Moreover, ""to the degree the recitation of the evidence was inflammatory, that was inherent in
Page 670
the odious . . . nature of the crime[] committed"" (citation omitted).  Commonwealth v. Johnson,
, 749 (1999).  The jury were properly instructed before the opening statements, and in the final charge, that the statements were not evidence.
Similarly, ""[c]losing arguments must be viewed 'in the context of the entire argument, and in light of the judge's instruction to the jury, and the evidence at trial.'""  Commonwealth v. Braley,
, 328-329 (2007), quoting Commonwealth v. Colon-Cruz,
, 553 (1990).  The defendant claims that the prosecutor improperly appealed to the jury's emotions when he encouraged the jurors to use their recollections of the view to evaluate the evidence.  He also claims that the prosecutor used improper forceful rhetoric in describing the victim's murder and the defendant's actions and that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct when he asked the jurors to hold the defendant accountable for his actions.
The prosecutor properly encouraged the jury to use their observations from the view to evaluate the evidence and aid in reaching their verdict.  See Commonwealth v. Corliss,
, 448 (2015), quoting Commonwealth v. Gomes,
, 199 (2011) (""[a]lthough what is seen on the view may be used by the jury in reaching their verdict, in a 'strict and narrow sense a view may be thought not to be evidence'"").  Similarly, the prosecutor's forceful rhetoric was based on the evidence without focusing on any unnecessarily emotional or inflammatory aspects of the evidence.  See Lyons, 426 Mass. at 472.  Moreover, the prosecutor's description of the victim's murder was based on the evidence and was relevant to establish the nature of the crime.  See Commonwealth v. Sanchez,
, 376 (1989), quoting Commonwealth v. Kozec,
, 521 (1987) (""Although this line of argument may evoke sympathy for the victim[], the argument went to the issues in the case and was 'based on what the jury saw and heard'"").  The judge instructed the jury prior to the arguments and in the final charge that closing statements were not evidence, and specifically instructed the jury to ""not decide this case in any way based on sympathy towards the victim or the victim's family or any sympathy towards the defendant.""  The prosecutor's statement reminding the jury that the victim's murder occurred nearly two years prior to the trial and that the time for the defendant's accountability is now, was not improper.  Although the statement regarding the defendant's accountability was better left unsaid, ""[t]he prosecutor's remarks
Page 671
were characteristic of 'enthusiastic rhetoric, strong advocacy, and excusable hyperbole,' and did not cross the line between fair and improper argument.""  Lyons, supra, quoting Commonwealth v. Sanna,
, 107 (1997).  Contrast Commonwealth v. Torres,
, 464-465 (2002) (improper argument where prosecutor asked jury to ""answer the call for justice and hold [the defendant] accountable for what he did"").  The prosecutor's statement ""falls within the category of permissible rhetoric and . . . there was no error.""  Commonwealth v. Mejia,
, 255 (2012).
The defendant claims that the prosecutor also improperly encouraged the jurors to use evidence that Montrond returned the rented Cadillac the day after the murder as evidence of the defendant's participation in the joint venture.  We do not agree.  The prosecutor was entitled to argue inferences from the evidence that are favorable to the Commonwealth's case.  See Lyons, 426 Mass. at 472.  The jury reasonably could infer that in order to cover up his participation in the joint venture, Montrond returned the Cadillac the day after the murder, before the end of his rental contract.  The jury could further infer the defendant's knowing participation based on his presence in the Cadillac that evening and the surveillance footage depicting the Cadillac following the defendant's vehicle on multiple occasions that evening.  See id.
Finally, the defendant's argument that the prosecutor improperly suggested that the jury's job was ""easier"" because they could find the defendant guilty of joint venture without determining whether he was the shooter or a coventurer is without merit.  The prosecutor correctly stated the law of joint venture and the Commonwealth's burden.  See Commonwealth v. Deane,
, 50-51 (2010) (""the Commonwealth is not required to prove exactly how a joint venturer participated in the murder[], . . . or which of the [coventurers] did the actual killing"" [citation omitted]).
4.  Evidentiary rulings.  The defendant argues that the judge committed reversible error in (1) allowing inadmissible statements that unfairly bolstered the Commonwealth's theory of gang retaliation and (2) allowing improper ""interpretive"" testimony from the lead homicide detective.  We address these arguments in turn.
a.  Statements by the victim's friends.  The defendant challenges the admission of statements from Rosa and one of the women who were with him that night describing their concern for the victim after the defendant's statement, ""You don't belong here.""
Page 672
The admission of the statements was not improper, as they were not admitted for their truth and, thus, not hearsay.  See Mass. G. Evid. § 801 (2017).  The judge noted that the witnesses' statements were admissible ""to put in context"" the victim's statement of intent to go inside the bar and have a drink.  There was no error or abuse of discretion in admitting these statements.  See L.L. v. Commonwealth,
, 185 n.27 (2014).
b.  Teixeira's statements.  The defendant challenges three of Teixeira's statements, made after she discovered that the victim had been murdered, admitted under the excited or spontaneous utterance hearsay exception through the testimony of a police officer.  As Teixeira was being transported to Boston police headquarters, she exclaimed, ""They're going to kill me for this.""  Thereafter, while she was waiting to be interviewed by homicide detectives, Teixeira stated, ""These people want to kill people because of the fucking street.""  And during her interview with homicide detectives, Teixeira said, ""I'm going to die for this.""  There was no error.
A statement is ""[a] spontaneous utterance if (A) there is an occurrence or event sufficiently startling to render inoperative the normal reflective thought processes of the observer, and (B) the declarant's statement was a spontaneous reaction to the occurrence or event and not the result of reflective thought.""  Mass. G. Evid. § 803(2) (2017).  See Commonwealth v. Santiago,
, 623 (2002).  ""[T]here can be no definite and fixed time limit [between the incident and the statement].  Each case must depend upon its own circumstances.""  Mass. G. Evid. § 803(2) note, quoting Commonwealth v. McLaughlin,
, 223 (1973).  ""[T]he nexus between the statement and the event that produced it is but one of many factors to consider in determining whether the declarant was, in fact, under the sway of the exciting event when she made the statement.""  Santiago, supra at 625.  A trial judge's determination that an utterance meets the test of admissibility should be given deference and ""only in clear cases . . . of an improper exercise of discretion should [the judge's] ruling be revised"" (citation omitted).  McLaughlin, supra.
Here, the Commonwealth used Teixeira's statements to support its theory that the victim's murder was motivated by the ongoing feud between the Wendover Street and Woodward Avenue gangs and by retaliation for the defendant's and Lopes's injuries from the December, 2011, altercation with a leader of the Wendover Street gang.  Her statements occurred after she discovered the
Page 673
body of the victim, whom she had been seeing romantically, after he had been shot to death.  Teixeira was hysterical.  Prior to her first challenged statement, she was found by police lying on the sidewalk screaming and crying.  Officers had to physically restrain Teixeira from returning to the victim's body and hold her up so that she did not collapse, as she was unable to stand on her own.  Based on her behavior and body language, it was plain that her presence during the victim's shooting and the discovery of his body was a sufficiently startling event.  See Commonwealth v. Irene,
, 607, cert. denied, 568 U.S. 968 (2012) (""We have viewed the circumstances of being shot, or witnessing a shooting, as sufficiently startling to impede normal reflective thought processes"").  Additionally, just prior to Teixeira's statements at police headquarters, she was so emotional that she became physically ill.  Teixeira's emotional demeanor and physical illness shortly after the victim's murder and the discovery of his body are sufficient to demonstrate that Teixeira's statements were ""a spontaneous reaction to the [victim's murder] and not the result of reflective thought.""  Mass. G. Evid. § 803(2).  ""Because both criteria of the spontaneous utterance exception were satisfied, the testimony was admissible.""  Irene, supra.
c.  ""Interpretive"" testimony.  The defendant challenges the admission of the testimony of Detective Brian Black, one of the lead investigators on the case, on the ground that it was improper interpretive testimony that went beyond the bounds of proper lay witness testimony.  Because the defendant objected to Black's testimony, we review any error for prejudicial error.  See Commonwealth v. Canty,
, 545 (2013).
Here, Black testified regarding the approximately four minute and thirty second time discrepancy between the bar's video surveillance footage and the defendant's GPS data.  The judge allowed Black to review a compilation of the video surveillance footage side-by-side with the GPS data to help explain the investigative significance of the evidence when the time discrepancy is accounted for.  Black testified that he had assisted in the creation of the compilation, discerned the extent of the time discrepancy between the video surveillance footage and the defendant's GPS data, and had detailed familiarity with the evidence.  His testimony properly assisted the jury in evaluating the evidence and understanding the time discrepancy.  See Mass. G. Evid. § 701 & note (2017).  Moreover, the defendant was not prejudiced by Black's testimony regarding the time discrepancy because the
Page 674
defendant's own witness gave similar testimony, opining that the time discrepancy was approximately four minutes and thirty-five seconds.  The defendant's witness also attempted to resolve the time discrepancy by synchronizing the bar's surveillance footage and the defendant's GPS data.  There was no error.
5.  Ineffective assistance of counsel.  The defendant argues that trial counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance in failing to present evidence that would have countered the Commonwealth's theory of gang retaliation.  Specifically, the defendant asserts that trial counsel should have ""offered or directed the jury's attention to"" (1) a Boston police memorandum detailing the December 24, 2011, altercation, which included a nonexhaustive list of active Wendover Street gang and Woodward Avenue gang associates, and which failed to list the victim as a Wendover Street gang associate; (2) the voir dire testimony of the victim's sister that he was an ""associate,"" not a member, of the Wendover Street gang; and (3) the defendant's GPS data and cellular telephone evidence that would counter the Commonwealth's theory that the defendant had been stalking or searching for the victim.
""Where, as here, the defendant has been convicted of murder in the first degree, we review his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel to determine whether the alleged lapse created a 'substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice,' a standard more favorable to the defendant than the constitutional standard otherwise applied under Commonwealth v. Saferian,
, 96 (1974).""  Commonwealth v. Fulgiam,
, 29 (2017), quoting Wright, 411 Mass. at 681-682.  ""We focus more broadly on whether there was error and, if so, whether any such error 'was likely to have influenced the jury's conclusion.'""  Fulgiam, supra, quoting Wright, supra.  ""The burden is on the defendant to demonstrate that something inappropriate was likely to have unfairly influenced the jury's verdict.""  Commonwealth v. Painten,
, 550 (1999).
Here, the defendant argues that counsel's failure to direct the jury's attention to the aforementioned pieces of evidence or seek their admission likely influenced the jury's verdict.  We disagree.  The defendant failed to establish how admission of the police memorandum and the testimony of the victim's sister that the victim was not a full-fledged member of the Wendover Street gang would have countered the Commonwealth's theory of gang retaliation.  See id.  The Commonwealth provided evidence that
Page 675
the victim was an ""associate"" of the Wendover Street gang and that he had a friendship with a leader of that gang, who was involved in the December 24, 2011, altercation with the defendant, Lopes, and Montrond.  Similarly, evidence that the defendant traveled in the same area prior to seeing the victim at the bar does not counter the reasonable inference that after the defendant left the bar, having seen the victim, the defendant was searching the area for the victim as part of a joint venture to commit premeditated murder.  See id.  The defendant's assertion that trial counsel was ineffective is unavailing.
6.  Motion to dismiss indictments.  The defendant argues that the motion judge erred in denying his motion to dismiss indictments, pursuant to Commonwealth v. McCarthy,
, 161-163 (1982), because the Commonwealth failed to establish probable cause to believe that the defendant committed the victim's murder.  This argument has no merit.
""Probable cause to sustain an indictment is a decidedly low standard.""  Commonwealth v. Hanright,
, 311 (2013).  ""[A]t the very least the grand jury must hear sufficient evidence to establish the identity of the accused, . . . and probable cause to arrest him"" (citation omitted).  McCarthy, 385 Mass. at 163.  ""Probable cause has been defined as 'reasonably trustworthy information . . . sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that the defendant had committed or was committing an offense.'""  Hanright, supra at 311-312, quoting Commonwealth v. Stevens, 362 Mass. 20 , 26 (1972).  ""Where, as here, the liability of a joint venturer is at issue, the Commonwealth must present the grand jury with evidence that the defendant both participated in, and shared the requisite mental state for, each crime charged.""  Hanright, supra at 312.  When reviewing the sufficiency of an indictment, the grand jury evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth.  See Commonwealth v. Moran,
, 885 (2009).
Here, the Commonwealth presented to the grand jury sufficient evidence to sustain an indictment for the murder in the first degree of the victim as part of a joint venture.  The evidence established that the defendant, Lopes, and Montrond were at the bar on the night of the murder.  Video surveillance footage from the bar established that the SUV driven by the defendant and the Cadillac driven by Montrond were circling the area of the bar that night.  Thirty minutes before the shooting, the defendant searched the bar.  Prior to the shooting, the defendant told the victim he
Page 676
should not be in the area before speeding off, which made some of the victim's friends concerned.  Despite Rosa's suggestion otherwise, the victim decided to go into the bar and have a drink.  The victim changed his mind after smoking a cigarette outside the bar and decided to leave.  The victim told Teixeira about the defendant's threat as they were walking toward the victim's vehicle and confirmed that the defendant was the person who made the threat.  Teixeira saw a man with braids, who she identified as the defendant, walking toward the vehicle and heard the victim say something like, ""You gonna do me like this, J?"" before the victim was shot.  Finally, the defendant's GPS data placed him within fifteen feet of the victim at or about the time of the shooting.  Based on the evidence presented to the grand jury, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, there was probable cause to believe that the defendant knowingly participated and shared in the intent to commit the premeditated murder of the victim.  See Hanright, 466 Mass. at 312.
7.  Review pursuant to G. L. c. 278, § 33E.  After a full review of the trial record, we affirm the conviction and decline to grant extraordinary relief pursuant to G. L. c. 278, § 33E.

Discussion of the emergency aid exemption to the requirement of a warrant prior to entry of a dwelling, and of the requirement that the Commonwealth demonstrate both that there were objectively reasonable grounds to believe that an emergency existed at the time of entry and also that the conduct of police officers after they entered the premises was reasonable under the circumstances. [610-613]
A Superior Court judge properly granted the criminal defendant's pretrial motion to suppress evidence discovered after police officers' warrantless entry into an apartment building, where the entry into one of the apartments was not justified under the emergency aid exception to the warrant requirement, in that the totality of the circumstance at the time of the entry did not support an objectively reasonable basis to believe that an emergency existed. [613-614]
A Superior Court judge properly granted the criminal defendant's pretrial motion to suppress evidence discovered after police officers' warrantless entry into an apartment building, where the entry into one of the apartments was not justified under the probable cause and exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement, in that the officers lacked a reasonable basis to believe that they or others were at risk of imminent harm and there was little risk of a suspect's flight from within the building, and in that, although a close case, the officers lacked probable cause to believe that a crime had been or was being committed, given that the circumstances confronting the officers at the scene did not corroborate a 911 caller's tip and her reliability therefore was insufficient. [614-622] Lowy, J., concurring.","
In this case, we confront the scope of two exceptions to the warrant requirement that have resulted in some confusion in previous jurisprudence in the Commonwealth:  the emergency aid exception and the exigent circumstances exception.

1.  Background.  a.  Facts.  We summarize the facts found by the motion judge following an evidentiary hearing on the defendant's motion to suppress, supplemented by uncontroverted and undisputed facts in the record that were implicitly credited by the judge and that do not detract from the judge's ultimate findings.  See Commonwealth v. Jones-Pannell,
, 431 (2015).  We reserve some details for later discussion.
On the evening of March 4, 2014, the Lawrence police department received a tip from an unnamed 911 caller.
The caller stated that she was ""coming down the street"" when she saw two ""Spanish guys"" ""with a gun . . . going up to the building"" located at ""7 Royal Street"" in a residential neighborhood in Lawrence.  The caller stated that ""they . . . had a hat on,"" and were wearing ""a jacket and a coat,"" one of which ""was gr[a]y and the other was black.""  The caller ""heard . . . one of them load the gun,"" and saw the men enter the building.  The caller said that ""there's always a little movement in that building,"" and acknowledged that she was ""not really sure what's going on.""  In addition, the caller stated that she was new to the neighborhood, and that she had not seen the men previously.  She provided the dispatcher with her home address, and the dispatcher indicated to the caller that he was aware of the caller's telephone number.
Page 606
A dispatcher subsequently issued the following report:  ""Any detective or any available north car [near the specified address], caller said she saw two Hispanic males enter a house, one in a gray jacket, one in a black jacket, the male was loading gun, was loading a cli[p] to a handgun.""

The motion judge credited that, during the general period in which the 911 call was made, the Lawrence police department was investigating a ""rash"" of ""home invasions"" believed to be the work of a ""crew"" from New York.  The judge noted, however, that the evidence did not indicate ""how recently or where"" the home invasions had occurred, or if any home invasion had ""occurred in the immediate vicinity or neighbor[hood] of"" the particular street.
Multiple police officers responded to the dispatch.  The address given was one of two numbers associated with a four-unit apartment building.  The building had a single front door, marked with the number ""5"" on the right side of the door and the number ""7"" on the left side of the door.  The building contained two apartments on the ground floor, numbered ""5A"" and ""7A,"" and two apartments on the upper floor, numbered ""5B"" and ""7B.""  At the rear of the building, there was a porch with two entrances.
Sergeant Michael Simard of the Lawrence police department was the supervising patrol sergeant that evening.  He arrived at the scene in a marked cruiser and was wearing a uniform.  Simard saw no one outside the building.  He and a number of other officers monitored the front entrance.
Sergeant Joseph Cerullo of the Lawrence police department's special operations division arrived at the scene in a marked cruiser; he, too, was wearing a uniform and a badge.
Cerullo and four other officers, including two members of the canine unit of the Essex County sheriff's department, moved to the rear of the building.
At the front of the building, Simard spoke to residents of unit 7A, the first-floor apartment located across the hall from unit 5A.  The residents of unit 7A denied seeing or hearing anything out of the ordinary, and said that they did not know who lived in unit 5A.  The residents did describe, however, the ""layout of the apartment [at unit 5A] as far as what door leads to where.""  Simard commented that the residents of unit 7A were scared because of
Page 607
the ""[fifteen] police officers with their guns drawn.""  Simard also stated that, except for the residents of unit 7A, no residents of the building appeared to be at home.
After obtaining the telephone number of the 911 caller, Simard spoke with her by telephone.
The caller told Simard that she had seen three males whom she did not recognize talking on the front step of the building located at ""5-7"" on that street.  The caller stated that she had heard the sound of a ""rack"" being pulled back on a semiautomatic handgun,
a sound she recognized because she was ""from Lawrence.""  According to Simard, the caller did not see a firearm.  The caller was nervous, and was aware of recent armed robberies ""in the area.""  The judge found that the ""officers at the scene learned the above-described information within minutes of their arrival.""

Page 608
The caller told Simard that the men likely had a key to the building because they entered the front door ""easily.""  Cerullo acknowledged that he and the other officers did not consider whether the men who allegedly entered the building with a firearm were residents of the building.
At the rear of the building, Cerullo observed a Hispanic male leave the building from the left rear door.  The man had facial hair and was ""wearing a black and gray sweater.""  He was identified at the evidentiary hearing as ""Wascar Bievenido Guerrero Diaz.""
With his firearm drawn, Cerullo shouted, ""Lawrence Police.  Show me your hands.""  From the front of the building, Simard was able to hear Cerullo.  Diaz appeared ""shocked"" and ""quickly went back inside"" the building, ""closing the door behind him.""  Cerullo and another officer attempted to enter the building through the door Diaz had used, but, as the judge determined, they ""found it locked.""
According to Cerullo, the door was associated with apartment ""number 5.""  Cerullo did not specify whether he was referring to apartment 5A, 5B, or both.
Cerullo moved to the front of the building to discuss the situation with Simard, while four officers remained at the rear of the building.  Focusing their attention on unit 5A, Cerullo and Simard made the decision to enter that unit without a warrant.

Within approximately three to eight minutes after police arrived at the scene, Cerullo ""entered the front door forcefully,"" and then led a number of officers through the front door of the building and into unit 5A.  Conducting a ""protective sweep"" for any injured persons and the Hispanic male he had seen earlier at the rear of the building, Cerullo moved through the living room toward the rear of the building.  Other officers searched different areas of the apartment.  They did not find any people, but they did observe in plain view what appeared to be illegal narcotics, a scale, and plastic bags strewn on the floor.  The officers did not seize anything at that point.
At the rear of the apartment, Cerullo encountered a door leading to a hallway outside unit 5A.  In the hallway, he saw another door.
Page 609
The officers believed that this was the door that Diaz had used minutes earlier.  Cerullo also saw a stairway leading up to unit 5B and down to a basement; a light was on in the basement.  After confirming the absence of any people inside unit 5A, Cerullo, other officers, and several canine unit dogs searched the basement; they found and arrested three individuals.  They did not search anywhere else in the building for the suspected home invaders.
Based on observations made during the warrantless search of unit 5A, officers obtained a search warrant.  Pursuant to the warrant, they searched unit 5A again and seized items from the apartment.
b.  Procedural history.  The defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence seized pursuant to the warrant, on the ground that the warrant was predicated on observations made during an unconstitutional search.  Following an evidentiary hearing, a Superior Court judge allowed the motion.
The Commonwealth filed a petition seeking leave to pursue an interlocutory appeal, and a single justice of this court allowed the appeal to proceed in the Appeals Court.  In a split decision, a panel of the Appeals Court reversed the motion judge, after concluding that the warrantless search was permissible under the emergency aid doctrine.  See Commonwealth v. Arias,
, 449 (2017).  We allowed the defendant's application for further appellate review.
2.  Discussion.  ""In reviewing a ruling on a motion to suppress, we accept the judge's subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error 'but conduct an independent review of [the judge's] ultimate findings and conclusions of law.'""  Commonwealth v. Cawthron,
, 616 (2018), quoting Commonwealth v. Scott,
, 646 (2004).
A ""warrantless government search of a home is presumptively unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.""  Commonwealth v. Entwistle,
, 213 (2012), cert. denied, 568 U.S. 1129 (2013).  See Kentucky v. King, 563 U.S. 452, 459 (2011); Brigham City v. Stuart, 547 U.S. 398, 403 (2006).  ""The presumption against warrantless searches reflects the importance of the warrant requirement to our democratic society.""  Commonwealth v. Tyree,
, 683 (2010).  ""Under the exclusionary rule, evidence seized pursuant to an unreasonable search
Page 610
generally will be suppressed.""  Commonwealth v. Tuschall,
, 584 (2017).  ""Warrantless searches may be justifiable, however, if the circumstances of the search fall within an established exception to the warrant requirement.""  Id.
a.  Emergency aid exception.  The emergency aid doctrine establishes one such ""narrow exception to the warrant requirement.""  See Commonwealth v. Duncan,
, 754, cert. denied, 135 S. Ct. 224 (2014).  The emergency aid exception applies when law enforcement officers enter a dwelling to provide emergency assistance.  See Commonwealth v. Snell,
, 774, cert. denied, 527 U.S. 1010 (1999) (entry is reasonable under emergency aid exception when made ""not to gather evidence of criminal activity but rather, because of an emergency, to respond to an immediate need for assistance"" [citation omitted]).
To fall within the narrowly construed emergency aid exception, ""a warrantless entry and protective sweep must meet two strict requirements.""  See Commonwealth v. Peters,
, 823 (2009).  First, at the time of entry, there must be an objectively reasonable basis for the officers to believe that an emergency exists.  See Entwistle, 463 Mass. at 213.  Second, after the entry, the conduct of the officers must be reasonable under the circumstances, id. at 216; in other words, the search must not exceed the scope of the emergency.  See Peters, supra.  ""Where these two conditions have been satisfied, warrantless entry into a home is permissible.""  Duncan, 467 Mass. at 751.  The ""burden rests with the Commonwealth to demonstrate that a warrantless search . . . fits within the emergency aid exception to the warrant requirement.""  Entwistle, supra at 215, quoting Peters, supra.  See Snell, 428 Mass. at 774-775.
i.  Objectively reasonable belief.  To meet its burden, the Commonwealth first must demonstrate objectively reasonable grounds to believe that an emergency existed at the time of entry.  See Peters, 453 Mass. at 823.  See also Hill v. Walsh, 884 F.3d 16, 19 (1st Cir. 2018) (warrantless entry into dwelling requires ""objectively reasonable basis for believing"" that ""immediate aid"" is required by someone within [citation omitted]).
In determining whether a warrantless entry is objectively justified, we evaluate it ""in relation to the scene as it could appear to the officers at the time, not as it may seem to a scholar after the event with the benefit of leisured retrospective analysis"" (citation omitted).  Peters, 453 Mass. at 825.  A reviewing court does not consider officers' subjective motivations in entering a house.  See,
Page 611
e.g., Entwistle, 463 Mass. at 214.  See also Michigan v. Fisher, 558 U.S. 45, 47 (2009).
The reasonableness of an entry is evaluated under the totality of the circumstances.  Compare Tuschall, 476 Mass. at 585-588 (warrantless entry was unreasonable when fumes adversely affected neighbor and her pet, but did not threaten imminent injury, death, or explosion, and there was no indication anyone inside dwelling required emergency assistance), with Commonwealth v. Townsend,
, 426 (2009) (warrantless entry was reasonable where dwelling was victim's last known location, her vehicle was parked outside, she had not been seen or heard from in days, and she had missed scheduled visits with her children and her roommate).  See, e.g., Entwistle, 463 Mass. at 210, 215-216 (warrantless entry was reasonable where victim had not been seen or heard from in days, had uncharacteristically missed multiple appointments with family and friends, and victim's dog could be heard barking inside house); Snell, 428 Mass. at 768-769, 775 (warrantless entry was reasonable where victim's vehicle remained parked outside house for multiple days, victim had not answered multiple telephone calls from her children, and victim had not called to wish her son's wife happy birthday).
Entering officers ""do not need ironclad proof of 'a likely serious, life-threatening' injury,"" Entwistle, 463 Mass. at 214, quoting Fisher, 558 U.S. at 49, in order for a warrantless entry to be reasonable under the circumstances.  In addition, because the entry is made ""to prevent harm stemming from a dangerous condition, not to investigate criminal activity,"" a reviewing court ""does not require that police have probable cause that a crime has been committed.""  Tuschall, 476 Mass. at 585.  See Duncan, 467 Mass. at 750; Hill, 884 F.3d at 23.  It is sufficient where the totality of the circumstances demonstrates objectively reasonable grounds to believe that emergency assistance is needed to prevent imminent physical harm, to provide assistance to one who is injured, or to protect life or, in some circumstances, property.
See, e.g., Entwistle, supra at 214, 216.
ii.  Reasonableness of police conduct inside the dwelling.  To rely upon the emergency aid doctrine, the Commonwealth also must
Page 612
demonstrate that the conduct of the officers after they entered the premises was reasonable under the circumstances.  See Entwistle, 463 Mass. at 216.  To be reasonable, the warrantless conduct of the officers inside the dwelling must be ""strictly circumscribed"" by the circumstances of the emergency that justified entry.  See Commonwealth v. Lewin (No. 1),
, 622 (1990), quoting Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U.S. 385, 393 (1978).  Thus, a protective sweep made pursuant to the emergency aid exception ""must be limited in scope to its purpose,"" Peters, 453 Mass. at 823, e.g., to preventing imminent harm, protecting life or property,
or providing aid to one who is injured.
In addition, to be reasonable under the emergency aid doctrine, the officers' conduct after entry ""may not be expanded into a general search for evidence of criminal activity.""  See Entwistle, 463 Mass. at 217, citing Arizona v. Hicks, 480 U.S. 321, 325 (1987).  See also Lewin (No. 1), 407 Mass. at 622.  Therefore, if, after entry, officers no longer have an objectively reasonable basis to believe that an emergency exists, it is unreasonable to continue searching.  See Mincey, 437 U.S. at 393 (warrantless search was unreasonable when conducted after officers had located all persons in dwelling during prior protective sweep); Commonwealth v. Kaeppeler,
, 403 (2015) (""continued police presence in the defendant's home without his consent after he was transported to the hospital for medical treatment and the subsequent seizure of [evidence in plain view] was unreasonable,"" because emergency concerning ""the defendant's well-being had ended,"" and evidence was seized for ""an investigative purpose""); Peters, 453 Mass. at 820 (warrantless search of dwelling was unconstitutional after protective sweep eliminated objectively reasonable basis to believe that emergency existed).
After completing a protective sweep, however, if officers continue to have an objectively reasonable basis to believe that an emergency exists, a subsequent sweep that is limited to the scope of the emergency may be justified.  See Entwistle, 463 Mass. at 215-219 (two instances of law enforcement entry coupled with protective sweeps were justified under emergency aid exception, because each was supported by objectively reasonable bases to believe that emergency existed, and officers' conduct during each sweep was reasonably limited to scope of emergency at hand); Peters, 453 Mass. at 825 (""We do not declare a 'one sweep rule'"" . . .).
Page 613
Undoubtedly, when officers have an objectively reasonable basis to believe that an emergency exists, and they reasonably circumscribe the scope of their conduct after entry, ""[e]vidence observed in plain view may be seized,"" Peters, 453 Mass. at 823, provided that the officers ""have not violated the Fourth Amendment in arriving at the spot from which the observation of the evidence is made,"" King, 563 U.S. at 463; the ""incriminating character"" of the evidence is ""immediately apparent"" (citation omitted), Kaeppeler, 473 Mass. at 405; and the evidence actually is in plain view.  See, e.g., Hicks, 480 U.S. at 324-325, 328 (""a truly cursory inspection -- one that involves merely looking at what is already exposed to view, without disturbing it -- is not a 'search' for Fourth Amendment purposes,"" but disturbing or moving objects in plain view constitutes ""a 'search'"" for which warrant is required); Entwistle, 463 Mass. at 217 (observation of content of printed bill fell within scope of emergency aid exception where ""[t]he officer did not open a bill still in its envelope or search for it in a file or drawer; he merely read what was in plain view from an already opened bill that lay on the kitchen table"").
With these considerations in mind, we turn to the search at issue.
iii.  Initial search of unit 5A and basement.  The defendant maintains that the officers who entered unit 5A and the basement without a warrant lacked objectively reasonable grounds to believe that an emergency existed.  The Commonwealth, for its part, acknowledges an ""absence of precedent"" justifying the officers' warrantless entry under the emergency aid doctrine.
As the motion judge noted, the ""Commonwealth's claim that the officers had reason for concern that an armed man was present inside the apartment building is not completely without merit.""  ""[P]olice need not wait for screams from within in order to fear for the safety of occupants or themselves.""  United States v. Lenoir, 318 F.3d 725, 730 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 841 (2003).  Entry into unit 5A pursuant to the emergency aid exception, however, required an objectively reasonable basis to believe that an emergency existed.  See, e.g., Fisher, 558 U.S. at 47; Tuschall, 476 Mass. at 585.  The totality of the circumstances at the time of the entry into unit 5A did not support such a basis.
When the officers arrived at the scene in response to the 911 call, they saw and heard no signs of disturbance, and detected no signs of forced entry.  To the contrary, they observed that the doors to the building, and to unit 5A, were closed and intact.  Moreover, when Simard spoke with the 911 caller, she said that the men had
Page 614
entered the building ""easily,"" because they likely had a key.  The officers interviewed residents of unit 7A and learned that the residents, too, had seen and heard nothing suspicious or out of the ordinary.  No one else informed the officers of any commotion, noises, or sounds coming from unit 5A.  As the motion judge found, the officers had no knowledge of any residents or victims inside unit 5A, and the only residents of any unit the officers knew were present were the unharmed residents of unit 7A.
The fact that Diaz was observed at the back of the building does not transform the situation into an emergency.  There was no indication that he was injured, in need of emergency assistance, armed, or about to harm others, or that he had harmed others.
Regardless of whether the officers had sincerely held beliefs as to the existence of an armed home invasion or hostage situation, their subjective beliefs at the scene cannot justify a search under the emergency aid exception.  See, e.g., Stuart, 547 U.S. at 404; Entwistle, 463 Mass. at 214.  The totality of the circumstances at the time of entry here did not establish a reasonable basis to believe that an emergency existed in unit 5A.
See Tuschall, 476 Mass. at 585-587.  Therefore, the warrantless search was not justified under the emergency aid exception.
Our analysis does not end there, however.  We turn to consider whether the entry was justified for some other reason, i.e., under the probable cause and exigent circumstances exception.
b.  Probable cause and exigent circumstances exception.  The judge concluded that, under the exigent circumstances doctrine, the facts confronting the officers did not establish the existence of an exigency, or probable cause of an armed home invasion or hostage situation in progress.
Pursuant to both art. 14 and the Fourth Amendment, the exigent circumstances doctrine establishes another ""well-recognized,"" King, 563 U.S. at 460, yet ""narrow"" exception to the warrant requirement, see Tyree, 455 Mass. at 691.  See also Commonwealth v. Young,
, 456 (1981) (""Exigencies which may justify a procedure
Page 615
without warrant are a narrow category and must be established by the Commonwealth . . .""); Commonwealth v. Forde,
, 800 (1975) (""the standards as to exigency are strict"").
""In the absence of a warrant, two conditions must be met in order for a nonconsensual entry to be valid"" under the exigent circumstances doctrine:  (1) ""there must be probable cause"" and (2) ""there must be exigent circumstances.""  Commonwealth v. DeJesus,
, 619 (2003).  See Figueroa, 468 Mass. at 211-212.  In this way, ""[t]he exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement may be more appropriately denominated the exception for probable cause
exigent circumstances"" (emphasis in original).  J.A. Grasso, Jr. & C.M. McEvoy, Suppression Matters Under Massachusetts Law § 14-1[a] (2017).  See Kirk v. Louisiana, 536 U.S. 635, 638 (2002) (per curiam) (""police officers need either a warrant or probable cause plus exigent circumstances in order to make a lawful entry into a home"").  Put differently, when probable cause exists to believe that a crime has occurred, is occurring, or will occur imminently, warrantless entry is justified only if exigent circumstances also are present.  See Figueroa, supra at 213.  Conversely, without probable cause, the existence of an exigency is insufficient to permit warrantless entry into a dwelling.  See id.
The Commonwealth ""bears the burden of proof"" to establish that a warrantless search was proper.  See Young, 382 Mass. at 456.  See also Tyree, 455 Mass. at 684 (""Given the high value that our Federal and Massachusetts Constitutions assign to the warrant requirement, particularly in relation to a dwelling, we impose a heavy burden on the Commonwealth to justify every warrantless search:  in the absence of consent, the Commonwealth must prove both probable cause to enter the dwelling and the existence of exigent circumstances"" [footnote omitted]).
When entry is lawful under the exigent circumstances doctrine, ""the police, in accordance with the rule of 'plain view,' [may] take into their possession material having apparent evidential connection to the criminal activity they were in course of investigating"" (footnote omitted).  Young, 382 Mass. at 458.  See, e.g., King, 563 U.S. at 463 (""[i]t is . . . an essential predicate to any valid warrantless seizure of incriminating evidence that the officer did not violate the Fourth Amendment in arriving at the place from which the evidence could be plainly viewed"" [citation omitted]); Forde, 367 Mass. at 807 (""the police had no legal justification for being present in the apartment and [therefore] cannot rely on the 'plain view' doctrine for a warrantless seizure of contraband"").
Page 616
We begin with the question of exigency.
i.  Exigency.  A warrantless entry is justified only if, in addition to the existence of probable cause, exigent circumstances are present.  See Figueroa, 468 Mass. at 213.  See also King, 563 U.S. at 470 (""Any warrantless entry based on exigent circumstances must, of course, be supported by a genuine exigency"").  ""[A]bsent exigent circumstances, the firm line at the entrance to the house . . . may not reasonably be crossed without a warrant"" (quotations and citation omitted).  See Kirk, 536 U.S. at 635.
For exigent circumstances to exist, officers must have ""reasonable grounds to believe that obtaining a warrant would be impracticable under the circumstances.""  Figueroa, 468 Mass. at 213.  Impracticability arises in the context of the exigent circumstances doctrine when the delay caused by obtaining a warrant would create ""a significant risk"" that ""the suspect may flee,"" ""evidence may be destroyed,"" or ""the safety of the police or others may be endangered.""  Id.  See Tyree, 455 Mass. at 685-691.
""In determining whether a warrantless search falls within the narrow exception of exigent circumstances, we consider 'the circumstances in their totality' . . ."" (citation omitted). Figueroa, 468 Mass. at 212.  See King, 563 U.S. at 464.  We review those circumstances objectively.  See Young, 382 Mass. at 456.  Thus, ""whether an exigency existed"" is a matter ""to be evaluated in relation to the scene as it could appear to the officers at the time,"" not as the scene might appear in hindsight.  Id.  See Figueroa, supra; DeJesus, 439 Mass. at 620 n.3.  The subjective beliefs or motives of an officer form no part of this inquiry.  See King, supra.  See also Commonwealth v. Washington,
, 485 (2007).
In the circumstances here, for the same reasons that the officers lacked objectively reasonable grounds to believe that residents of unit 5A were in danger, pursuant to the emergency aid doctrine, the officers lacked a reasonable basis to believe that they or others were at risk of imminent harm, pursuant to the exigent circumstances doctrine.  See Figueroa, 468 Mass. at 213.  At the scene, officers encountered no indications of violence or forced entry.  They were unaware of any resident or victim inside unit 5A.  Indeed, the only residents known to officers, those of unit 7A, were unharmed, and had neither seen nor heard anything suspicious.  In addition, when Diaz was seen at the rear of the building, there was no indication that he, the police, or anyone else was at risk of imminent injury.  We therefore agree with the motion judge
Page 617
that there was ""nothing indicative of an imminent threat of danger to persons inside the building or to the officers.""
In addition, because the building was surrounded by officers, there was little risk of a suspect's flight from within.  See Figueroa, 468 Mass. at 213.  Further, the record provides no basis for officers to have believed that evidence of an armed home invasion or hostage situation was at risk of destruction.  See id. at 214.
The investigation of a crime, even a serious crime such as an armed home invasion, does not itself establish an exigency.  See Mincey, 437 U.S. at 394 (""We decline to hold that the seriousness of the offense under investigation itself creates exigent circumstances of the kind that under the Fourth Amendment justify a warrantless search""); id. at 393 (""If the warrantless search of a homicide scene is reasonable, why not the warrantless search of the scene of a rape, a robbery, or a burglary?  No consideration relevant to the Fourth Amendment suggests any point of rational limitation of such a doctrine"" [quotation and citation omitted]).
Because officers lacked a reasonable basis to believe that an exigency existed in unit 5A, the warrantless search was impermissible.  See DeJesus, 439 Mass. at 620.  Even had the officers reasonably believed that an exigency existed, for the warrantless entry to be permissible, there also had to be probable cause that a crime was being committed inside the building.
ii.  Probable cause.  To justify an entry into a dwelling pursuant to the exigent circumstances doctrine, the Commonwealth must demonstrate the existence of probable cause.  See Tyree, 455 Mass. at 684.  ""[P]robable cause exists where . . . the facts and circumstances within the knowledge of the police are enough to warrant a prudent person in believing that [an] individual . . . has committed or was committing an offense"" (citation omitted).  Washington, 449 Mass. at 481.  Accordingly, ""an objective test is used to determine whether probable cause exists.""  Commonwealth v. Jewett,
, 629 (2015), quoting Commonwealth v. Franco,
, 639 (1995).
""In dealing with probable cause . . . we deal with probabilities.  These are not technical; they are . . . practical considerations of everyday life, on which reasonable and prudent [people], not legal technicians, act.""  Commonwealth v. Cartright,
, 283 (2017), quoting Jewett, 471 Mass. at 629.  ""Probable cause does not require . . . that police [have] resolved all their doubts.""  Cartright, supra, quoting Commonwealth v. Warren,
,
Page 618
90 (1994).  Rather, probable cause ""requires more than mere suspicion but something less than evidence [that would be] sufficient to [sustain] a conviction.""  Cartright, supra, quoting Jewett, supra.
A.  Informant's tip.  Where, as here, police seek to establish probable cause based on an informant's tip, they must show, pursuant to the two-prong Aguilar-Spinelli test, both that the tip is grounded in a basis of knowledge, and that it is reliable.  See Commonwealth v. Upton,
, 375 (1985).  See also Spinelli v. United States, 393 U.S. 410 (1969); Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108 (1964); Commonwealth v. Alfonso A.,
, 374 (2003).  With respect to informant tips, ""the test for determining probable cause is stricter under art. 14 . . . than under the Fourth Amendment.""  Upton, supra at 364.
In accordance with the Aguilar-Spinelli test, the Commonwealth first must establish the basis of knowledge underlying an informant's tip.  See Alfonso A., 438 Mass. at 374; Upton, 394 Mass. at 375.  In general, the basis of knowledge prong is satisfied where the information provided springs from an informant's firsthand observations or knowledge.  See Alfonso A., supra.  In addition, where an informant's tip is sufficiently detailed, a reviewing court reasonably may infer that the informant had a direct basis of knowledge.  Id. at 374-375.
If an informant's basis of knowledge is established, to justify the warrantless entry, the Commonwealth then must demonstrate that the tip was credible.  See Alfonso A., 438 Mass. at 375; Upton, 394 Mass. at 375.  Although a 911 caller's telephone number may be visible to, or determinable by, the 911 operator, under art. 14, that alone does not demonstrate sufficiently the reliability of a tip.  See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Depiero,
, 454-455 (2016) (in context of reasonable suspicion, where showing ""less rigorous"" than probable cause is permissible, this court was ""not inclined . . . to attribute veracity to all 911 callers"").  Rather, ""[w]hen assessing the reliability of [private individuals] who report apparent violations of the law, we accord more weight to the reliability of those who are identified . . . by name and address,"" because they are not protected ""from the consequences of prevarication that anonymity would afford, and consequently may be subject to charges of filing false reports and risk retaliation"" (citations omitted).  Commonwealth v. Cavitt,
, 628-629 (2011).  See Depiero, supra at 455 (""The veracity test is more difficult for the Commonwealth to satisfy where . . . the caller was
Page 619
anonymous.  Because the caller was anonymous, there could be no evidence regarding the caller's past reliability or reputation for honesty"" [citation omitted]).
At the same time, ""[i]t is important to recognize that [private individuals] who report criminal activity justifiably may be concerned for their own safety if their identity becomes known to the persons subsequently investigated or arrested, and for this reason may wish to remain anonymous.""  Cavitt, 460 Mass. at 629.  Such circumstances ""should not stand as an insurmountable impediment to a favorable assessment of [the informant's] reliability"" (citation omitted).  Id.  Therefore, an unidentified informant who nonetheless is ""identifiable"" by officers, see id., and who is aware that officers are able to identify him or her may receive greater credence than a fully anonymous informant.  See, e.g., Depiero, 473 Mass. at 455 (""even if the police are able to recover the telephone number and identity of 911 callers, it proves absolutely nothing unless . . . the anonymous caller was
of that fact.  It is the tipster's
in anonymity, not its
, that will control his [or her] behavior"" [emphasis in original; quotation and citation omitted]).
In addition, the reliability of a tip may be adduced from the extent to which an informant provides factual details.  See Alfonso A., 438 Mass. at 375 (""it is especially important that the tip describe the accused's criminal activity in sufficient detail that the [court] may know that [it] is relying on something more substantial than a casual rumor . . . or an accusation"" [citation omitted]).  See also Depiero, 473 Mass. at 457 (""details provide a level of corroboration beyond that of 'innocent' or easily obtainable facts""); Alfonso A., supra at 376 (""While . . . detail, by itself, does not ordinarily suffice to establish reliability, . . . it remains a factor in the over-all assessment of the informant's reliability"").
Each prong of the Aguilar-Spinelli test ""must be separately considered and satisfied or supplemented in some way.""  Upton, 394 Mass. at 375.  If an informant's tip fails to satisfy both prongs, other corroborating evidence, such as independent police corroboration, may be able to ""make up for deficiencies in either or both prongs.""

B.  Analysis.  Our inquiry into the issue of probable cause begins with the 911 call.  We are satisfied that the judge's subsidiary findings are substantiated by the record.  Although this case presents a close question of probable cause, we conclude, as the judge found, that the circumstances confronting the officers at the scene did not corroborate the caller's tip.
Page 620
As to the basis of knowledge prong, we note that the 911 caller informed the Lawrence police dispatcher that she saw two men ""going up to the building"" located at the specified address, and that she heard one of the men load the gun before he and his companion entered the building.  Thus, the basis of the 911 caller's firsthand knowledge was apparent from the initial tip itself.
Of course, carrying a firearm is not itself a crime in the Commonwealth.  See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Alvarado,
, 269 (1996).  But loading a handgun in public prior to entering a residential building does raise valid concerns about the possibility of imminent criminal conduct.  See Commonwealth v. Haskell,
, 793-794 (2003) (under less stringent standard for reasonable suspicion, as compared to standard for probable cause, ""the act of publicly loading a handgun is an event that creates a reasonable suspicion that a crime may be about to take place"").  Thus, the 911 caller claimed to have seen and heard what could have been criminal activity.
The more difficult question, however, is whether the officers had an adequate basis to conclude that the 911 caller's tip was reliable.  In this regard, the caller provided details adverse to a determination of probable cause.  She commented that the men talked calmly before entering the building, which they entered ""easily"" because they likely had a key.  In addition, although she said that she had never seen the men before, she acknowledged that she was new to the neighborhood and was unsure of what the men were doing.  The caller also provided details that, due to their conflicting nature, undermined her reliability.  She initially said that two men entered the building, but later told Simard that three men had entered the building.  Of course, the details provided by the caller constitute an important aspect of our assessment of her reliability.  See Alfonso A., 438 Mass. at 376.  Those details undercut the reliability of her tip.
Despite remaining unnamed, however, the 911 caller did give the dispatcher her home address.  She therefore was aware that officers could identify her.  See Depiero, 473 Mass. at 455.  In addition, police had the ability to trace the 911 call to the caller's telephone number.  Indeed, the dispatcher informed the caller that her telephone was associated with an address in Boston.  And Simard ultimately spoke with the caller by telephone to discuss her observations.  The 911 caller was therefore aware that another important component of her identity was known to officers.  We
Page 621
note, however, that ""knowledge of the informant's 'identity' and 'whereabouts,'"" are generally ""not . . . adequate standing alone to confirm the informant's reliability.""  See Alfonso A., 438 Mass. at 376.
As indicated, either prong of the Aguilar-Spinelli test may be supplemented by corroborating evidence.  See, e.g., Upton, 394 Mass. at 375.  See also Depiero, 473 Mass. at 456 (""the Commonwealth can . . . establish a caller's reliability through independent corroboration by police observation or investigation of the details of the information provided by the caller"" [quotation and citation omitted]).  Because the details of the 911 caller's tip undermined her reliability, the establishment of probable cause required independent corroboration.  Here, however, the officers discovered no corroborating evidence of criminal conduct; when they did not, the absence of probable cause became clear.
As discussed supra, Simard knew that the residents of unit 7A were unaware of any suspicious activity in unit 5A.  Moreover, he was aware that the men who entered the building did so ""easily,"" and that this was most likely because they had a key.  No witness said that there had been any sound or sign of trouble in unit 5A; and no officer observed any sound or sign of struggle, violence, forced entry, or damaged property.  We agree with the motion judge that ""nothing . . . indicated that the men who entered"" the building ""did not reside there.""
The judge also found that Diaz, who had facial hair and left the building dressed in a gray and black sweater, did not match the 911 caller's ""very general descriptions of two Hispanic men"" who had entered the building, one of whom wore a gray jacket and the other of whom wore a black jacket, and neither of whom had facial hair.  See Commonwealth v. Warren,
, 535-536 (2016) (""general description of the perpetrator and his accomplices"" as ""two black males wearing . . . 'dark clothing,' and one black male wearing a 'red hoodie'"" made it unreasonable for police ""to target the defendant or any other black male wearing dark clothing as a suspect"").  Except for Diaz's gender and ethnicity, he did not match the 911 caller's general description of the men who had entered the multiunit apartment building earlier that evening.  Moreover, while the Commonwealth characterizes Diaz's retreat into the building as evidence of guilt, ""evasive conduct in the absence of any other information,"" id. at 538, is insufficient to support probable cause.
We acknowledge that this case presents a difficult question of probable cause, and that officers are at times required to make
Page 622
split-second decisions to avert violence.  The racking of a firearm in public prior to entering a residential building is indeed a troubling suggestion of possible violent activity.  In the circumstances here, however, given the absence of independent corroborating evidence, the reliability of the 911 caller's testimony was insufficient to establish probable cause under art. 14.
Order allowing motion to

  suppress affirmed.

I agree with the court that ""the warrantless search was not justified under the emergency aid exception.""  Ante at 614.  I also agree that the search was not justified under the probable cause and exigent circumstances exception ""[b]ecause officers lacked a reasonable basis to believe that an exigency existed in unit 5A.""  Id. at 617.  But unlike the court, I am convinced that the officers had probable cause to enter the apartment.
""Reasonableness must be evaluated in relation to the scene as it could appear to the officers at the time, not as it may seem to a scholar after the event with the benefit of leisured retrospective analysis"" (quotation omitted).  Commonwealth v. Kaeppeler,
, 402-403 (2015), quoting Commonwealth v. Townsend,
, 425-426 (2009).  When police act on information from a private citizen, ""the Commonwealth must show the basis of knowledge of the source of the information (the basis of knowledge test) and the underlying circumstances demonstrating that the source of the information was credible or the information reliable (veracity test).""  Commonwealth v. Depiero,
, 454 (2016), quoting Commonwealth v. Anderson,
, 622, cert. denied, 568 U.S. 946 (2012).
Here, the court concedes that ""the basis of the 911 caller's firsthand knowledge was apparent from the initial tip itself.""  Ante at 620.  However, the court then concludes that the caller's veracity has not been established.  Id. at 620-622.  I disagree.
The court acknowledges that the caller ""was aware that officers could identify her"" and that Sergeant Michael Simard of the Lawrence police department ""ultimately spoke with the caller by telephone to discuss her observations.""  Ante at 620.  It then concludes that ""'knowledge of the informant's ""identity"" and ""whereabouts,""' are generally 'not . . . adequate standing alone to confirm the informant's reliability.'""  Id. at 621, quoting Commonwealth
Page 623
v. Alfonso A.,
, 376 (2003).  But this is not a situation in which the police merely knew the informant's identity.  Nor is it a situation in which the informant knew theoretically that the police had the ability to contact her by telephone.  Cf. Commonwealth v. Costa,
, 517 (2007) (reliability of caller who knew ""that her call was being recorded, and that the number she was calling from had been identified, . . . should have been accorded greater weight than that of an anonymous informant"").  Here, police did contact the informant by telephone, and the informant responded by continuing to cooperate and by providing significant additional information.  The caller also used a technical term, ""racking,"" to describe what she heard, and she explained that she was familiar with the sound because of personal experience.  See Alfonso A., supra (use of detail ""remains a factor in the over-all assessment of the informant's reliability"").

This reliable informant told police that she had observed two men with a gun enter a building at a specified address, and she claimed to have heard one of the men load a gun.
It is unusual for an individual to load a gun on the threshold of a private residence.  To do so in broad daylight accompanied by another individual only increases the unlikeliness that the firearm was being loaded for innocent purposes.  As the court correctly observes, ""loading a handgun in public prior to entering a residential building . . . raise[s] valid concerns about the possibility of imminent criminal conduct.""  Ante at 620.
In addition to having reliable information from the caller that a gun was being loaded in public, the police also knew about an ongoing investigation into home invasions in Lawrence.  And when
Page 624
they reached the address that the caller named, a man emerged from the building, only to retreat inside when an officer with a drawn gun told him to show his hands.  The police tried to open the door that the man had reentered, but it was locked.  There are many reasons why an individual might flee in the presence of the police.  See Commonwealth v. Warren,
, 540 (2016) (observing that black male, ""when approached by the police, might just as easily be motivated by the desire to avoid the recurring indignity of being racially profiled as by the desire to hide criminal activity"").  Nonetheless, it would seem to be an unusual occurrence when a person who is told by a police officer with a drawn weapon to show his hands ignores the command and reenters a residence, locking the door behind him.  The fleeing man here, combined with the tip that a gun was being loaded in public and the knowledge of prior home invasions, gave the police probable cause.

For the foregoing reasons, I concur.",,

A Superior Court judge erred in denying the criminal defendant's pretrial motion to suppress evidence that resulted from the search of an automobile in which he had been a passenger, where, although the police officers involved in the stop of the vehicle had reasonable suspicion that the passenger in the vehicle's rear seat had an outstanding warrant, the stop should have been discontinued once the officers determined that the passenger was not the individual with the outstanding warrant; therefore, one officer's request that the driver of the vehicle produce his license, and the officer's continued questioning of the occupants of the vehicle (including the defendant), constituted an unlawful seizure of the vehicle and its occupants, and the evidence resulting from the subsequent impoundment and search of the vehicle constituted the fruit of that unlawful seizure; further, the erroneous admission at trial of the evidence derived from the illegal seizure was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. [701-710]
At a murder trial, the judge did not err in admitting evidence of the defendant's involvement in a prior shooting one month earlier, where that evidence was relevant to prove the defendant's identity as the shooter in the instant killing and to show that the defendant had the means to commit the crime; and where the restrictions that the judge imposed on the scope of the evidence and the manner in which it was elicited adequately prevented any prejudice to the defendant. [711-714]
This court concluded that a criminal defendant who, prior to trial, had received copies of wiretap recordings obtained from a prosecution witness through his work as a confidential informant was entitled to another copy of the transcript prior to any retrial. [714-716]","
A jury convicted the defendant, Paulo Tavares, of murder in the first degree on the theories of deliberate premeditation and extreme atrocity or cruelty.
On appeal, the defendant raises three main issues.  First, he argues that a Superior Court judge (motion judge) erred in denying his pretrial motion to suppress evidence obtained from the search and seizure of a motor vehicle in which he was a passenger.  Second, he argues that a second Superior Court judge (trial judge) improperly admitted evidence of the defendant's involvement in a prior shooting.  Finally, he argues that the trial judge erred in denying the defendant's postconviction motions for a new trial based on ineffective assistance of counsel and for discovery of wiretap recordings of his conversations with a confidential informant.
For the reasons set forth infra, we conclude that the motion judge committed reversible error in denying the defendant's motion to suppress.  We also find that the defendant's motion for a new trial was properly denied, but that his motion for discovery should have been granted.  Accordingly, we vacate the convictions and remand for a new trial consistent with this opinion.

Background.  We recite the facts the jury could have found, reserving certain details for discussion of legal issues.
On the evening of May 21, 2007, John Lima was driving his sister's Nissan Altima automobile, along with his friend Jorell Archer, on a street in Brockton.  According to Archer, another car sped up and began to ""tail"" them with its high beam lights activated.  Lima became ""aggravated"" and applied his brakes, giving the car behind him a ""brake job"" as it followed them.  The other car then drove up to the passenger's side of the Altima, and someone fired seven or eight gunshots at them.
Page 696
Lima attempted to shield himself from the shots but could not do so because he was driving.  He then turned into a nearby parking lot, where the Altima slowed down and rolled into an apartment building.  At that point, Archer noticed that Lima had been shot.  Lima stated, ""I'm hit, I'm hit,"" and twice indicated to Archer that he believed he was dying.  The other car quickly sped away before Archer could determine the type of car or the number of people inside it.
Police found the Altima crashed into the building with all four of its windows shattered.  Archer was standing in front of the open driver's side door, while Lima was lying unresponsive in the driver's seat.  Lima was immediately transported to the hospital, where he died shortly thereafter.  An autopsy later revealed that he had been shot three times.  The medical examiner concluded that the cause of death was due to gunshot wounds.
At the scene, the police interviewed an eyewitness, Nicholas Melo, who had been sitting on his porch when he heard eight or nine loud bangs.  Melo then witnessed a car round the corner near his house, hit the curb, and speed down the street.  Melo initially told the police that he saw a Chevy Malibu Max, but later described it as a regular Chevy Malibu.
The day after the shooting, a police officer, accompanied by a State police trooper, was driving in an unmarked police cruiser in Brockton when he passed a Chevy Malibu.  The officer began searching for the Malibu, believing that he recognized an individual with an active arrest warrant in the back seat.  A few minutes later, he identified the Malibu and stopped it.
As he approached the vehicle, the officer quickly realized that the individual he was looking for was not in the back seat.  Instead, he found Christopher Hanson in the driver's seat, the defendant in the front passenger's seat, and Eddie Ortega in the back seat.  The officer made brief conversation with the three occupants before learning that Hanson was not on the rental agreement for the vehicle.  The officer then advised Hanson that because he was not listed on the rental agreement, the vehicle would have to be towed.  All three occupants left on foot.  The officers did not search the Malibu before towing it to the police station.  The officers then brought Melo to the police station, where he told the officers that he was ""sure"" that the Malibu was the same car he had seen the night before and stated that it should have scrape marks underneath the front driver's side quarter and the rear passenger's side quarter -- where the car had gone over the curb.
Page 697
He and a detective both looked under the Malibu, and the detective observed what appeared to be fresh scrape marks in the area where Melo said they would be.
At trial, Ortega testified about the moments immediately preceding the motor vehicle stop.  While riding in the back seat of the Malibu, Ortega heard the defendant and Hanson discuss the shooting that had occurred the previous night.  During this conversation, the defendant stated that he had shot the wrong person, and that the shooting was not supposed to ""go down"" like it had.  Ortega also heard the defendant admit to using a .22 caliber handgun in the shooting.  Additionally, Ortega testified that just before the vehicle was stopped, Hanson quickly turned onto a side street.  At that moment, the defendant took a .22 caliber handgun out of the glove compartment and threw it onto a nearby residential lawn.  After their encounter with the police officer, the three occupants returned to the side street and retrieved the gun.
The Commonwealth's primary witness at trial was Raymond Grinion, one of the defendant's friends and business associates.  The defendant and Grinion sold drugs together in Brockton.  For several years prior to the shooting, Grinion worked on and off with Brockton Police Detective Christopher McDermott as a paid confidential informant.
Sometime between December 2006 and January 2007, Grinion stole a .22 caliber handgun from a residence in New Hampshire.  He kept it for about two weeks before selling it to Jose Santos.  In March or April 2007, Santos gave the handgun to the defendant.  Grinion testified that he saw the defendant in possession of the gun ""on numerous occasions.""
The day after the shooting, Grinion received a call from the defendant.  During the call, the defendant told Grinion to get rid of his cell phone because the police had ""snatched up"" his girlfriend and she had given his cell phone number to them.  When Grinion asked for details, the defendant responded that it was about the ""homeboy"" he had ""bodied last night.""  Grinion testified that he believed this to mean that the defendant had killed someone the night before.
Following this conversation with the defendant, Grinion apparently told Detective McDermott that he believed the defendant was involved in the murder of Lima.  He also informed McDermott that the defendant admitted to using a .22 caliber handgun in the shooting.  Grinion then made arrangements with the police to conduct a controlled purchase of the gun from the defendant.
Page 698
Over the next several days, the defendant made various incriminating statements to Grinion about his involvement in the shooting.  Two days after the shooting, Grinion told the defendant that Santos was upset about the murder of Lima.  In response, the defendant stated, ""I know that.  That was my man too,"" and he further indicated that ""it was the wrong dude.  We hit the wrong dude.""  The defendant also stated that he was not worried about his earlier encounter with the police because ""he ha[d] shooting cases in the past,"" and because he knew ""how to get out of the car and to shoot.""  He further explained that the officer was joking with him and that ""he [didn't] think they [had] much evidence.""  A few days later, Grinion met the defendant at an apartment in Fall River, where he saw the defendant with the .22 caliber handgun.
On May 28, 2007, Grinion conducted a controlled purchase of the .22 caliber gun from the defendant.
When he gave Grinion the gun, the defendant instructed him not to ""drop any of the shells"" if Grinion used the gun because it was connected to a murder and another shooting.  Grinion asked whether the defendant had used the gun to kill someone, and the defendant responded that ""whoever bought it, they don't need to know all that.""
On May 31, 2007, Grinion returned to the apartment to meet with the defendant.  At that time, Grinion again told the defendant that Santos was upset about the shooting.  The defendant became irritated and responded that Grinion had ""a big mouth.""  He also indicated that he did not want Santos to know that he had lied about his involvement in the murder.
On June 1, 2007, the police executed an arrest warrant for the defendant.  The police then searched the Fall River apartment and recovered thirteen .22 caliber live rounds.  At trial, the Commonwealth introduced ballistics evidence collected from the scene of the shooting, which occurred on Main Street (Main Street shooting), including several .22 caliber shell casings.  A ballistics expert compared these shell casings to the .22 caliber gun recovered from the controlled purchase, and concluded that at least some of the casings were fired from that gun.
Over the defendant's objection, the Commonwealth also introduced evidence relating to the defendant's involvement in an
Page 699
earlier shooting that occurred about one month prior to Lima's killing on Exchange Street in Brockton (Exchange Street shooting).  Grinion testified that the defendant admitted to using the .22 caliber handgun in the Exchange Street shooting.  A ballistics expert also confirmed that three .22 caliber shell casings recovered from the scene of the prior shooting were fired from the .22 caliber handgun introduced in this case.
The jury eventually returned guilty verdicts on all three charges.  The defendant now appeals.
Discussion.  1.  Motion to suppress.  The defendant argues that the motion judge erred in denying his pretrial motion to suppress evidence obtained from the search and seizure of the Malibu.
In reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, we accept the motion judge's ""subsidiary findings absent clear error but conduct an independent review of [the] ultimate findings and conclusions of law"" (quotations omitted).  Commonwealth v. Jones-Pannell,
, 431 (2015), quoting Commonwealth v. Ramos,
, 742 (2015).  The judge's subsidiary findings may be supplemented with ""uncontroverted and undisputed"" evidence ""where the judge ""explicitly or implicitly credited the witness's testimony.""  Jones-Pannell, supra, quoting Commonwealth v. Isaiah I.,
, 337 (2007), S.C.,
(2008).
a.  Relevant facts.  We recite the facts as found by the motion judge.  In the middle of the afternoon on May 22, 2007, Brockton Police Detective Michael Schaaf and State Police Trooper Robert Fries were driving an unmarked police cruiser in Brockton.  The two were assigned to warrant apprehension duty.  Earlier that day, Detective McDermott briefed Schaaf about the prior night's shooting and summarized Melo's description of the suspect vehicle.  Specifically, McDermott described the suspect vehicle as a Chevy Malibu Max that was ""tannish or goldish in color"" and had a ""sloped back.""  He also stated that Melo believed the vehicle would have scrape marks on the bumper.  McDermott distributed copies of a printed photograph, provided by Melo, depicting what Melo believed the vehicle looked like.
Later that afternoon, while traveling on a street in Brockton, Schaaf observed a ""grayish-green"" Chevy Malibu headed in the opposite direction.  From the police cruiser, Schaaf observed three occupants in the vehicle.  Based on a three-second view of the vehicle, Schaaf believed that the rear passenger was Jose Correia, an individual who had an outstanding arrest warrant.
Schaaf and Fries reversed their direction, losing sight of the vehicle for about a minute before eventually finding it again.
Page 700
From this position, Schaaf was only able to view the back of the rear passenger's head.  Schaaf thereafter effected a stop by activating the cruiser's lights.
Schaaf approached the vehicle on the driver's side, while Fries approached from the passenger side.  As he approached, Schaaf realized that the rear passenger was not Correia.  He apologized to the three occupants and informed them that he had mistakenly thought the rear passenger saw someone else.  Schaaf had some familiarity with the passengers, and they recognized him.
The occupants and Schaaf then engaged in some small talk.
While talking with the occupants, Schaaf asked Hanson for his driver's license.  Hanson provided a valid driver's license and told Schaaf that the defendant had rented the vehicle.  Schaaf was then informed that the defendant's girlfriend had in fact rented the vehicle.  Based on this verbal exchange, Schaaf asked to see the rental agreement.  He reviewed the agreement and observed that none of the vehicle's occupants was listed as authorized operators.
Schaaf then informed all three occupants that they were not allowed to drive the vehicle, and that he intended to secure the vehicle for the renter to retrieve it.  The three occupants left on foot.  Schaaf did not conduct a search of the vehicle or the occupants at that time.
After the occupants had left the scene, Schaaf realized that the vehicle might be the same vehicle suspected of being involved in the prior night's shooting.  He noted that although the vehicle was a regular Chevy Malibu, not a Malibu Max as Melo had initially described, and was ""grayish-green"" rather than gold or tan in color, he believed it had a ""sloped back"" similar to Melo's description.  Schaaf then contacted Detective McDermott and described the vehicle to him.  Based on Schaaf's description, McDermott ordered the car towed to the police station, where it was parked in the station's garage and cordoned off with yellow police tape.
At the police station, McDermott and another detective spoke to the renter of the vehicle, Deolinda Andrade.  During the conversation, Andrade stated that she had given someone else permission to drive the rental car.  McDermott informed Andrade that
Page 701
she may have violated her rental agreement by allowing an unlisted individual to drive the vehicle.  He then called the rental company and was informed that Andrade's rental agreement would be terminated due to the violation.  Based on this information, McDermott decided not to release the vehicle to Andrade.
Several hours later, the police brought Melo to the police station so that he could look at the exterior of the vehicle.  Melo immediately recognized the vehicle as the one he had observed the night before.
The following day, McDermott obtained written consent from the rental company to search the vehicle.  The vehicle was then transported to State Police headquarters, where it was searched.

The defendant filed a pretrial motion to suppress, arguing that the stop, seizure, impoundment, and search of the Malibu violated his rights under Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.  Specifically, the defendant sought to suppress the following evidence that resulted from the search:  (i) Melo's identification of the vehicle, (ii) the exterior damage to the vehicle, and (iii) the fingerprints obtained from the vehicle.  The motion was denied after a hearing.
b.  Analysis.  On appeal, the defendant reprises the arguments he made in support of his motion to suppress.  He claims that the officers should not have stopped the Malibu once they realized that they had mistakenly identified the rear passenger, or at least that the stop should have been immediately discontinued.  He also asserts that the officers had no basis to impound the vehicle or tow it to the police station, and that the subsequent search of vehicle was therefore unconstitutional.  We agree that the stop should have been discontinued once the officers determined that Correia was not in the vehicle, and that the unnecessarily prolonged stop constituted an illegal seizure.  We further conclude that, under the circumstances here, the evidence obtained from the subsequent impoundment and search of the Malibu was the direct result of the illegal seizure of the defendant, and that the Commonwealth has failed to meet its burden of proving that the evidence from the Malibu was sufficiently attenuated from the illegal seizure such that it should not be deemed a forbidden ""fruit of the poisonous tree"" under art. 14.  Accordingly, the motion
Page 702
judge erred in denying the defendant's motion to suppress the evidence obtained from the search of the Malibu.
i.  Initial stop of the vehicle.  Under the Fourth Amendment and art. 14, an individual has the right to be free from all unreasonable searches and seizures.  Commonwealth v. Buckley,
, 865 (2018).  A motor vehicle stop constitutes a seizure of all individuals detained in the stop.  See Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. 806, 809-810 (1996); Commonwealth v. Rodriguez,
, 773 (2015).  The police may stop a motor vehicle to ""make a threshold inquiry where suspicious conduct gives the officer reason to suspect that a person has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime.""  Commonwealth v. Watson,
, 729 (2000), quoting Commonwealth v. Silva,
, 405 (1974).  See Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 21-22 (1968).  In reviewing the constitutionality of a motor vehicle stop, we must determine ""first, whether the initiation of the investigation by the police was permissible in the circumstances, and second, whether the scope of the search was justified by the circumstances.""  Commonwealth v. Moses,
, 140 (1990), citing Silva, supra at 21.
To effect a valid investigatory stop, the police must have reasonable suspicion of criminal activity ""based on specific and articulable facts and the specific reasonable inferences which follow from such facts in light of the officer's experience.""  Silva, 366 Mass. at 406, citing Terry, 392 U.S. at 21.  Here, the officers had sufficiently articulable facts to support a reasonable suspicion that the passenger in the back seat of the vehicle had an active warrant for his arrest.  Cf. Commonwealth v. Owens,
, 599 (1993) (motor vehicle stop warranted by reasonable belief that registered owner, who had active warrant for his arrest, was driving vehicle).  The motion judge credited Detective Schaaf's testimony that he had previous knowledge of Correia's active arrest warrant.  Schaaf also testified that he was familiar with Correia's physical appearance.  Although his view of the Malibu was both distant and brief, Schaaf's observation of the Malibu's occupants supported his reasonable, albeit mistaken, belief that Correia was the rear passenger.  Cf. Commonwealth v. Garden,
, 46 (2008) (motor vehicle stop warranted by mistaken belief that registered owner was driving with suspended license).  Thus, the motion judge properly concluded that the initial stop was reasonable.
ii. Duration of the stop.  We must next determine whether the scope of the stop was justified under the circumstances.  The
Page 703
motion judge found that although Detective Schaaf quickly realized Correia was not the rear passenger, his request for Hanson's driver's license was a ""minimal intrusion upon the operator.""  The motion judge also concluded that Schaaf acted reasonably in requesting the rental agreement, thereby continuing the stop, because he had received ""concurrent conflicting information regarding who had rented and was legitimately responsible for the Malibu.""  We disagree.
A valid investigatory stop ""cannot 'last longer than reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop.'""  Commonwealth v. Amado,
, 151 (2016), quoting Commonwealth v. Cruz,
, 465 (2011).  See Commonwealth v. Sinforoso,
, 323 (2001).  The scope of a stop may only extend beyond its initial purpose if the officer is confronted with facts giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that ""further criminal conduct is afoot"" (citation omitted).  Commonwealth v. Cordero,
, 243 (2017).  Where an officer conducts an ""uneventful threshold inquiry giving rise to no further suspicion of criminal activity, he may not prolong the detention or expand the inquiry"" (citation omitted).  Buckley, 478 Mass. at 873.  See Commonwealth v. Gonsalves,
, 663 (1999) (noting that individuals do not expect police officers conducting traffic stops to engage in ""stalling tactics, obfuscation, strained conversation, or unjustified exit orders, to prolong the seizure in the hope that, sooner or later, the stop might yield up some evidence of an arrestable crime"").
Because the initial purpose of the stop in this case was to apprehend Correia, the stop should have concluded as soon as Detective Schaaf realized he had mistakenly identified the rear passenger, and nothing else had caused concern.  At that moment, the officers had no reason to continue the stop.  Garden, 451 Mass. at 46 (purpose of stop completed when officers discovered that registered owner of vehicle, who officers knew to have suspended license, was not driving).  See Cordero, 477 Mass. at 242, quoting Rodriguez v. United States, 135 S. Ct. 1609, 1614 (2015) (""Police authority to seize an individual ends 'when tasks tied to the [detention] are -- or reasonably should have been -- completed'"").  Thus, Detective Schaaf's request for Hanson's driver's license, coupled with his continued questioning of the occupants, including the defendant, constituted an unlawful seizure of the Malibu and its occupants.
The Commonwealth argues that the officers acted reasonably in
Page 704
extending the stop to clarify ownership of and responsibility for the Malibu.  To the extent Detective Schaaf received conflicting information
from the occupants on this point, this exchange did not provide a sufficient basis to continue the stop for the purpose of investigating the Malibu's rental status.  Schaaf credibly testified that he had no reason to believe that the Malibu had been stolen, or that Hanson lacked authorization from the renter to drive it.  The record provides no evidence that the occupants appeared nervous or responded evasively to Schaaf's inquiries.  The mere fact that the Malibu was rented,
without more, could not alone support a reasonable suspicion that the occupants were engaged in criminal conduct.  See Commonwealth v. Locke,
, 502 (2016) (defendant's statement that another individual rented vehicle did not contribute to reasonable suspicion of criminal activity); Commonwealth v. Bartlett,
, 471 (1996) (officer's knowledge that vehicle was rented by another individual did not support reasonable suspicion that defendant was engaged in drug-related activity).  Contrast Commonwealth v. Cabrera,
, 346-347 (2010) (officer's knowledge that vehicle was rented, coupled with defendant's evasive explanation as to ownership of vehicle, contributed to reasonable suspicion of drug-related activity).  In addition, the verbal exchange between Schaaf and the vehicle's occupants occurred after the officers had already completed the purpose of the stop.  Therefore, Schaaf's knowledge of the vehicle's rental status derived solely from an ""investigatory conversation for which [he] had no lawful basis.""  Bartlett, 41 Mass. App. Ct. at 472.  The initial stop was therefore unreasonably extended and constituted an illegal seizure.  Cf. Cordero, 477 Mass. at 247 (where purpose of motor vehicle stop was effectuated, and where no reasonable suspicion of additional criminal activity, police ""did not have a legitimate basis to detain the defendant, and the defendant should have been allowed to drive
Page 705
away""); Commonwealth v. Torres,
, 163 (1997) (continued detention of passengers after purpose of stop had been satisfied constituted illegal seizure).  See J.A. Grasso, Jr. & C.M. McEvoy, Suppression Matters Under Massachusetts Law § 4-4[b] (2017) (""investigative detention must be temporary and must last no longer than necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop"").  The motion judge therefore erred in finding that the officers validly extended the scope of the initial stop.
iii.  The impoundment and search of the Malibu as fruit of the poisonous tree.  Rather than letting the occupants drive away in the vehicle, as the police were required to do, the police continued their investigatory questioning and eventually forced the passengers out of the Malibu and impounded it.  Evidence resulting from a subsequent search of the vehicle included Melo's identification of the vehicle as the one he had seen on the night of the shooting, the exterior damage to the vehicle, and the latent fingerprints belonging to the defendant obtained from the interior of the vehicle.  The defendant argues that all of this evidence should have been suppressed under the exclusionary rule.  We agree.
As an initial matter, the Commonwealth argues that the defendant does not have standing to challenge the admission of this evidence because, as the passenger of a rental vehicle operated by someone other than the renter, the defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the impounded Malibu or its exterior.  This argument, however, misses the mark.
Standing under the Fourth Amendment requires the defendant to establish a reasonable expectation of privacy in the area searched or the item seized.  Commonwealth v. Mubdi,
, 391 (2010).  Under art. 14, by contrast, the question of standing remains separate from the question of reasonable expectation of privacy.  Commonwealth v. Williams,
, 208 (2009) (standing and reasonable expectation of privacy are ""interrelated,"" but considered ""separately"").  Ordinarily, a defendant has standing if he or she has either ""a possessory interest in the place searched or in the property seized or if [he or] she was present when the search occurred.""
Id.
Page 706
There is no question that the defendant had standing to challenge the legality of the seizure of his person when police stopped the Malibu and detained its occupants for an extended period of time.  Whren, 517 U.S. at 809-810 (""Temporary detention of individuals during the stop of an automobile by the police, even if only for a brief period and for a limited purpose, constitutes a 'seizure' of 'persons'"" under Fourth Amendment).  He also would reasonably expect that the police would leave him and the other passengers in the vehicle alone and let them drive away if the police had no proper reason for detaining them and the vehicle.  See Gonsalves, 429 Mass. at 663 (""Citizens do not expect that police officers handling a routine traffic violation will engage,
, in stalling tactics, obfuscation, strained conversation, or unjustified exit orders, to prolong the seizure in the hope that, sooner or later, the stop might yield up some evidence of an arrestable crime"" [emphasis added]).  Thus, at least during the unreasonably prolonged detention of the defendant and the vehicle in which he was traveling, there is no question that he had standing to challenge the seizure.  As this prolonged detention was unconstitutional, and the evidence at issue flowed therefrom, the proper focus is on fruit of the poisonous tree, not whether the defendant had standing or a reasonable expectation of privacy in the Malibu at the time of its impoundment.  See Commonwealth v. Fredericq,
, 78-79 (2019).
""Under what has become known as the 'fruit of the poisonous tree' doctrine, the exclusionary rule bars the use of evidence derived from an unconstitutional search or seizure.""  Fredericq, 482 Mass. at 78.  See Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 487-488 (1963).  In determining whether the evidence is considered a fruit of the poisonous tree, we consider ""'whether . . . the evidence . . . has been come at by exploitation of [that] illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.'""  Fredericq, supra, quoting Commonwealth v. Damiano,
, 453 (2005).
It matters not whether the defendant in this case had standing or a reasonable expectation of privacy in the Malibu once it was impounded by the police.  As we have recently noted, evidence may be suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree ""even if it is found in a place where the defendant has no reasonable expectation
Page 707
of privacy.""  Fredericq, 482 Mass. at 78, discussing Wong Sun, 371 U.S. at 486-487.  Accordingly, we have held that persons subjected to an illegal seizure are ""entitled to suppress the fruits of that seizure even where the evidence was discovered in places where it is indisputable that the person in question did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy.""  Fredericq, supra at 79.
The Commonwealth bears the burden of establishing that the evidence it has ""obtained and intends to use is sufficiently attenuated from the underlying illegality so as to be purged from its taint"" (quotation omitted).  Id. at 78, quoting Damiano, supra at 454.  We conclude that the Commonwealth has failed to meet that burden here.
The Commonwealth obtained the evidence identified supra as a direct result of the illegal seizure of the defendant and the car in which he was traveling.  Indeed, without the illegal seizure, the police would have had no grounds to impound the vehicle and conduct a search of it.  Rather, the defendant and the other occupants of the vehicle would have, and should have, been free to leave in the vehicle following the initial stop.  The impoundment and subsequent search occurred close in time to the illegal seizure, and there were no intervening circumstances between the illegal conduct and the later discovery of the evidence that would have been sufficient to dissipate the taint of the illegal seizure.  See Commonwealth v. Long,
, 536 (2017) (factors bearing on attenuation include ""length of time between the [illegal act] and the discovery of the evidence [temporal attenuation]; whether any circumstances intervened between the illegal act and the discovery of the evidence [intervening circumstances]; and how integral the unlawful search was to the acquisition of the evidence [purpose and flagrancy of the unlawful conduct]"").  Although the illegal police misconduct here may not have been flagrant, this factor is not dispositive when balanced against the other two.  Cf. Fredericq, 482 Mass. at 81-85 (no attenuation where evidence was obtained in close proximity to illegality and there were no intervening circumstances, even where police misconduct was neither flagrant nor purposeful); Commonwealth v. Estabrook,
, 864-865 (2015) (same).  Accordingly, the seizure of the evidence from the Malibu was derived as a result of the exploitation of the illegal seizure, rather than by ""means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the
Page 708
primary taint"" (citation omitted).  Damiano, 444 Mass. at 453.
The evidence therefore should have been suppressed as the fruit of the poisonous tree.  Cf. Torres, 424 Mass. at 163 (continued detention of defendant and passenger no longer necessary after defendant satisfied purpose of stop by producing license and registration; all evidence seized after that point suppressed as fruit of poisonous tree).  Its admission in evidence at trial was thus error.

Page 709
iv.  Harmless error.  Because the defendant moved to suppress this evidence before trial, we review the constitutional error to determine whether it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  Commonwealth v. Tyree,
, 700 (2010), quoting Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967). Our review under this standard considers a number of factors, including:
""[1] the importance of the evidence in the prosecution's case; [2] the relationship between the evidence and the premise of the defense; [3] who introduced the issue at trial; [4] the frequency of the reference; [5] whether the erroneously admitted evidence was merely cumulative of properly admitted evidence; [6] the availability or effect of curative instructions; and [7] the weight or quantum of evidence of guilt.""
Commonwealth v. Seino,
, 467-468 (2018), quoting Commonwealth v. Dagraca,
, 553 (2006).  We then must decide, based ""on the totality of the record before us, weighing the properly admitted and the improperly admitted evidence together, [whether] we are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the tainted evidence did not have an effect on the jury and did not contribute to the jury's verdicts.""  Tyree, 455 Mass. at 701.
The evidence obtained from the Malibu and introduced in evidence by the Commonwealth was particularly important in connecting the defendant to the shooting.  Through Melo's trial testimony and the distinctive scraping found underneath the car, the Commonwealth sought to prove that the impounded Malibu was the suspect vehicle involved in the shooting.  At trial, Melo
Page 710
testified that he saw a gold or tan Chevy Malibu round the corner near his house, hit the curb on the right side of the intersection, and drive down his street at a high rate of speed.  Melo's testimony was compelling, particularly because he stated that the bottom of the right side of the Malibu would have distinctive scrape marks from when the vehicle rounded the turn, and the car proved to have such marks.  Melo also unequivocally identified the Malibu once he saw it at the station.  This identification was corroborated by police testimony demonstrating that the Malibu's exterior damage was consistent with damage to the Altima that Lima was driving at the time of the shooting.
Although this evidence does not conclusively connect the defendant to the crime, his presence in the Malibu the following day strongly suggested his involvement in the murder.  The Commonwealth unmistakably relied on this evidence, highlighting its significance during opening and closing arguments.  Indeed, without the evidence obtained from the Malibu, the Commonwealth's case falls predominantly on Grinion's testimony and ballistics evidence collected from the scene.  Although this untainted evidence was sufficient to convict the defendant, we cannot say that it was ""so powerful as to nullify any effect that the improperly admitted evidence might have had"" on the jury or the verdict (quotations and citations omitted).  Commonwealth v. Dame,
, 537, cert. denied, 137 S. Ct. 132 (2016).  As Grinion was an informant with a troubled history, his credibility was vulnerable.  We therefore conclude that the erroneous admission of evidence deriving from the illegal seizure of the defendant was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  The defendant's convictions must therefore be vacated.
Because the evidence at trial was sufficient to support his convictions, however, we address other claims of error that are likely to recur upon retrial.

Page 711
2. Prior bad acts evidence.  The defendant claims that the trial judge erred in admitting evidence relating to the defendant's involvement in a prior shooting.  On April 28, 2007, less than one month before the Main Street shooting on May 21, 2007, there was a shooting on Exchange Street in Brockton.  The police recovered three .22 caliber shell casings from the scene of the Exchange Street shooting.  They later found ten .22 caliber shell casings and four .40 caliber shell casings at the scene of the Main Street shooting.
At trial, the jury heard testimony about the defendant's involvement in the prior Exchange Street shooting.  Grinion testified that the defendant told him that he had used a .22 caliber handgun -- the same handgun Grinion recovered from a controlled purchase on May 28, 2007 -- in a shooting on Exchange Street the previous month.  Ortega also testified that the defendant admitted to his involvement in a prior shooting on Exchange Street.  Both witnesses testified that they had seen the defendant in possession of the .22 caliber handgun on more than one occasion prior to May 21, 2007.
A ballistics expert examined the three .22 caliber casings from the Exchange Street shooting and the ten .22 caliber casings from the Main Street shooting.  He also test-fired the .22 caliber handgun that Grinion retrieved from the defendant.  At trial, the expert testified that eight out of the ten casings from Main Street and all three of the casings from Exchange Street were fired from that same .22 caliber handgun.
This evidence was the subject of a motion in limine at trial.  After hearing from both parties, the trial judge allowed the admission of this evidence, concluding that it was relevant to identify the defendant as the person who shot Lima, and to show that he had the means to commit the crime.  In his postconviction motion for a new trial, the defendant argued that the probative value of this evidence was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect.  The motion judge, who was also the trial judge, denied the motion.
Page 712
As the defendant objected to the admission of this evidence at trial, we review for prejudicial error.  See Commonwealth v. Imbert,
, 586 (2018).  We must first determine whether the judge committed an error of law or an abuse of discretion.  Commonwealth v. Camacho,
, 591 (2015).  A judge's discretionary decision constitutes an abuse of discretion where the judge makes a ""clear error of judgment in weighing the factors relevant to the decision . . . such that the decision falls outside the range of reasonable alternatives"" (quotation and citation omitted).  L.L. v. Commonwealth,
, 185 n.27 (2014).  If we find such an error, we then ask whether it was prejudicial.  Commonwealth v. Cruz,
, 561 (2005).
As a general rule, evidence of a defendant's prior bad act is inadmissible to show the defendant's bad character or propensity to commit a crime.  Commonwealth v. Jackson,
, 835 (1994).  See Mass. G. Evid. § 404(b)(1) (2019). This type of evidence may be admissible, however, if it is relevant ""for some other purpose . . . such as to show a common scheme, pattern of operation, absence of accident or mistake, identity, intent, or motive"" (citation omitted).  Commonwealth v. Copney,
, 412 (2014).  See Mass. G. Evid. § 404(b)(2).  It may also be admitted to show that the defendant had the means to commit the crime.  Commonwealth v. Ridge,
, 322 (2009).  The trial judge must exclude such evidence, even if relevant, where its probative value is outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice.  Commonwealth v. Crayton,
, 249 (2014).  Where a trial judge admits evidence of a defendant's prior bad act, the court must determine whether the judge committed palpable error.  Commonwealth v. Corliss,
, 450 (2015).
To admit a defendant's prior bad act as relevant to identity, there must be ""a special mark or distinctiveness in the way the acts were committed"" that tends to prove the defendant committed the crime charged.  Commonwealth v. Brusgulis,
, 505 (1990).  It is not enough that there is some ""general, although less than unique or distinct, similarity between the incidents.""  Id. at 507.  In addition, the prior incident and the crime charged must be proximate in both time and place.  Commonwealth v. Leonard,
, 786 (1999).
In this case, the trial judge concluded that evidence of the defendant's involvement in the prior Exchange Street shooting was relevant to prove his identity as the shooter who killed Lima.  We agree.  Based on the defendant's own admissions to Grinion
Page 713
and Ortega, the jury could have reasonably concluded by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant used a .22 caliber handgun in the prior Exchange Street shooting.  See Commonwealth v. Kater,
, 415 (2000); Mass. G. Evid. § 104(b).  See also Commonwealth v. Meola,
, 308 n. 13 (2019), quoting Huddleston v. United States, 485 U.S. 681, 690 (1988).  The ballistics evidence admitted at trial linked this same .22 caliber handgun to both the Exchange Street shooting and the Main Street shooting.  In addition, these two shootings were proximate in both time and place, as they each occurred in Brockton approximately one month apart.  See Commonwealth v. Helfant,
, 228 n.13 (1986) (""There is no bright-line test for determining temporal remoteness of evidence of prior misconduct"").  Additionally, this evidence corroborated Grinion's testimony that the defendant had been involved in the Exchange Street shooting.  Thus, the trial judge properly concluded that evidence of the defendant's involvement in the prior Exchange Street shooting was relevant to establish his identity as the shooter in this case.
Furthermore, evidence that the defendant possessed the .22 caliber handgun, and used it in the prior shooting, was also relevant to show that he had the means to commit the crime.  See Commonwealth v. Barbosa,
, 122 (2012) (""A weapon that could have been used in the course of a crime is admissible, in the judge's discretion, even without direct proof that the particular weapon was in fact used in the commission of the crime"").  See also Commonwealth v. Vazquez,
, 448-449 (2017) (witness testimony that defendant was observed with firearm one month prior to shooting was admissible absent definitive evidence that firearm was not murder weapon); Commonwealth v. McGee,
, 156 (2014) (evidence that defendant possessed firearm consistent with type of weapon used to kill victim was admissible to show that defendant had means to commit crime); Commonwealth v. Ashman,
, 744 (2000) (evidence of two knives found in defendant's bedroom four days after victim's death was admissible where one knife matched description of murder weapon).
Finally, we find that the trial judge correctly concluded that the probative value of the evidence was not outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice.  At trial, the judge limited the evidence to testimony that the defendant admitted to possessing and shooting the .22 caliber handgun in the prior Exchange Street shooting, and
Page 714
ballistics evidence that the same .22 caliber handgun was used in the shooting of Lima.  The jury were not permitted to hear evidence that the defendant shot, or intended to shoot, anyone in the Exchange Street shooting.
In addition, the judge instructed the Commonwealth to use leading questions so as to limit the testimony presented.  In light of the highly probative nature of the evidence, we find that these restrictions adequately prevented any prejudice to the defendant.  We therefore find no error in the judge's decision to admit evidence of the defendant's prior bad acts.
3.  Motions for postconviction discovery and a new trial.  Prior to trial, defense counsel was provided copies of the wiretap recordings obtained by Grinion through his work as a confidential informant.  Defense counsel moved to suppress the recordings, which consisted of conversations among the defendant, Ortega, and Grinion occurring between May 29 and 31, 2007.  These recordings were authorized by a search warrant pursuant to G. L. c. 272, § 99, and Commonwealth v. Blood,
, 66 (1987).
In support of the motion to suppress, trial counsel successfully argued that the wiretap recordings were obtained unlawfully, in violation of G. L. c. 272, § 99 B 7, because the investigation was not in connection with organized crime.  The motion was allowed and upheld by this court on appeal.  See generally Commonwealth v. Tavares,
, 290 (2011).  The suppressed recordings were not admitted at trial, nor was there any mention that the defendant's conversations were recorded.
Following his conviction, the defendant filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective in failing to seek the suppression of evidence derived from the wiretap recordings pursuant to G. L. c. 272, § 99 P.  He also filed a motion for postconviction discovery to obtain copies or transcripts of the wiretap recordings.  The motion judge, who was also the trial judge, denied the motions.
The defendant now appeals.  As we have determined that a new trial is required due to the failure to suppress the evidence derived from the motor vehicle stop, we only resolve those issues necessary for any subsequent trial.
Page 715
Under the Massachusetts wiretap statute, a criminal defendant ""may move to suppress the contents of any intercepted wire or oral communication or evidence derived therefrom"" if the interception was made in violation of the statute.  G. L. c. 272, § 99 P.  A witness's live testimony about a recorded conversation, however, need not be suppressed if it is ""not the product of an unauthorized interception but is independent of it.""  Commonwealth v. Jarabek,
, 299-300 (1981).  By contrast, the testimony should be suppressed if the witness relies on his or her ""listening to the unlawfully obtained recording.""  Id. at 300 n.7.  See Commonwealth v. Ortiz,
, 142 (2000) (no error in admitting undercover officer's live testimony based on his ""investigation and recollection of the criminal events"").
We agree with the motion judge's finding that the defendant failed to identify any specific evidence admitted at trial that was derived from the unlawful recordings.  The suppressed recordings were not admitted as evidence, nor was there any mention at trial that the defendant's conversations were recorded.  During the pretrial proceedings, trial counsel reminded the court that the wiretap recordings had been suppressed, and reiterated his concern that one of the witnesses would inadvertently discuss the recordings.  In his affidavit, trial counsel also stated that he did not file a motion to suppress because he ""did not think that any evidence had been derived from the wiretap recordings involved in this case.""
The defendant has thus failed to demonstrate with any specificity how the unlawful recordings may have affected the admissibility of Grinion's trial testimony.  The defendant argues more persuasively, however, that his ability to do so was hamstrung completely by the denial of his motion for posttrial discovery of the recordings themselves.  The defendant asserts that, without access to the recordings on appeal, he could not effectively argue in support of his motion for a new trial.  An examination of the recordings, he contends, is necessary to identify the specific evidence introduced at trial which derived from the recordings.  He further asserts that the Commonwealth's ""refusal to produce the tape or transcript of the illegal wiretap"" violated his constitutional right to due process of law under both the Federal and State Constitutions.  See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87-88 (1963); Commonwealth v. Tucceri,
, 405 (1992).
Although we need not decide whether a new trial is warranted for this reason alone, we conclude that the defendant is entitled to
Page 716
another copy of the transcript prior to any retrial.  This transcript will enable defense counsel to examine whether there is any improper reliance on the suppressed recordings at any future trial.  Grinion's testimony will be critical at any subsequent retrial, providing further justification for defense counsel's access to the suppressed recordings.
Because the defendant is entitled to discovery of the recordings, we need not address the validity of his constitutional claims.  The Commonwealth is hereby ordered to disclose the suppressed wiretap recordings, or a copy of the recording transcripts, to the defendant prior to any retrial.
Conclusion.  For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the denial of the defendant's motion to suppress, vacate the defendant's convictions, and remand for a new trial consistent with this opinion.
So ordered.",,
COMMONWEALTH vs. RUI M,"Police officers, acting on the basis of an informant's tip that he had seen an individual with a handgun, ""seized"" a defendant within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, where one of the officers pursued the defendant, pointed at him, and said, ""Come here"" [173-176]; however, the mere fact of possession or carrying of a weapon, without more, did not give rise to an objectively reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, at the time of seizure, as required to conduct a stop and frisk; the defendant's motion to suppress evidence produced by the stop and frisk should have been allowed [176-178].

Robert C. Thompson, Assistant District Attorney, for the Commonwealth.
Sheila T. Curran for the defendant.","SPINA, J. The defendant, Rui M. Barros, was convicted in the District Court of carrying a firearm without a license and possession of ammunition without a firearm identification card. On appeal he claims error in the denial of his motion to suppress the firearm and the ammunition taken from his person after a police officer stopped him based on an anonymous tip and, he argues, without reasonable suspicion to believe he was committing a crime. The Appeals Court, concluding that the police of-
Page 172
ficer ""had insufficient basis to detain and search the defendant"" when he did, vacated the order denying the defendant's motion to suppress and reversed his convictions. Commonwealth v. Barros, 49 Mass. App. Ct. 613 , 614 (2000). We granted the Commonwealth's application for further appellate review. We reach the same conclusion as the Appeals Court and reverse the defendant's convictions.
1. Background. The facts are set forth in the opinion of the Appeals Court, and need not be repeated in detail. Acting on an anonymous tip he had just received [Note 1], Brockton police Officer Christopher McDermott, who was on duty and in uniform, drove his marked cruiser to the area of Main and Hancock Streets to look for a light-skinned Cape Verdean male, approximately five feet, six inches tall, wearing a blue baseball cap, a blue and white T-shirt, and blue jeans. The anonymous informant reported seeing the man take a handgun from his waistband and show it to others who were with him.
Within about three minutes of receiving the tip, McDermott came upon a group of Cape Verdean males walking along Main Street. One, the defendant, was similar in appearance to the description given by the informant. The officer recognized the defendant as someone he previously had told not to ""hang around"" in front of stores in that neighborhood. He did not know whether the defendant was carrying a weapon. He drove alongside the group and said to the defendant, ""Hey you . . . I want to speak with you."" The defendant looked at the officer, but otherwise kept walking and ignored the request. McDermott stopped his cruiser, got out, walked up to the defendant and, as two other officers arrived, pointed at him and said, ""Hey you. I wanna talk to you. Come here."" The defendant turned away from the officer, then stopped [Note 2].
The defendant moved his hands toward the front of his waistband. Concerned for his safety, McDermott drew his
Page 173
service weapon and told the defendant to raise his hands. The defendant did not respond, so the officer repeated his command. The defendant raised his hands, then turned and faced the officer, taking four steps backward. Concerned that the defendant would flee, the officer handcuffed him, pat frisked him, and removed a loaded handgun from the front of the defendant's waistband. When asked whether he had a license to carry the firearm, the defendant said he did not. He was placed under arrest.
In denying the motion to suppress, the motion judge concluded that (1) the initial interaction between the officer and the defendant involved merely two requests that the defendant stop and speak with the officer; (2) the information provided by the informant was corroborated by the officer's own observations of the defendant's appearance and the gesture the defendant made to the front of his waistband while his back was turned toward the officer; (3) the officer was justified in undertaking the precautionary measures that he did for his own safety; and (4) the defendant was seized in a constitutional sense only when the officer drew his service firearm.
2. Seizure of the defendant. The Appeals Court correctly perceived that determining the precise moment of seizure was critical to resolution of the issue of suppression. Commonwealth v. Barros, 49 Mass. App. Ct. 613 , 616-618 (2000). If, as the motion judge determined, seizure occurred when the officer drew his weapon out of concern for his own safety after the defendant made the gesture toward his waistband, then the motion to suppress was correctly denied. See Commonwealth v. Fraser, 410 Mass. 541 , 544-545 & n.4 (1991). If, however, seizure occurred when the officer pursued the defendant, pointed at him and said, ""Come here,"" as the defendant argues [Note 3], the result is altogether different. See Commonwealth v. Barros, supra at 616-617.
Police have seized a person in the constitutional sense ""only if, in view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident, a
Page 174
reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave."" United States v. Mendenhall, 446 U.S. 544, 554 (1980) (opinion of Stewart, J.) [Note 4]. Under the Mendenhall test, the police do not effectuate a seizure merely by asking questions unless the circumstances of the encounter are sufficiently intimidating that a reasonable person would believe that he was not free to turn his back on his interrogator and walk away. See id. at 555. See also Immigration & Naturalization Serv. v. Delgado, 466 U.S. 210, 216-217 (1984); Florida v. Royer, 460 U.S. 491, 497 (1983); Commonwealth v. Sanchez, 403 Mass. 640 , 644-645 (1988); 4 W.R. LaFave, Search and Seizure s. 9.3(a), at 88-93 (3d ed. 1996).
The judge's finding that McDermott's initial request to the defendant to stop for questioning was not a seizure is supported by the record. McDermott remained in his cruiser while asking to speak to the defendant, and he did not impede or restrict the defendant's freedom of movement. As we stated in Commonwealth v. Murdough, 428 Mass. 760 , 763 (1999), ""officers may make inquiry of anyone they wish and knock on any door, so long as they do not implicitly or explicitly assert that the person inquired of is not free to ignore their inquiries."" See Immigration & Naturalization Serv. v. Delgado, supra at 216 (""police questioning, by itself, is unlikely to result in a Fourth Amendment [to the United States Constitution] violation""); Commonwealth v. Stoute, 422 Mass. 782 , 789 (1996) (""not every encounter between a law enforcement official and a member of the public constitutes an intrusion of constitutional dimensions requiring justification""). See also Florida v. Bostick, 501 U.S. 429, 434 (1991); United States v. Young, 105 F.3d (1st Cir. 1997).
However, the officer's second request had a compulsory dimension to it that his first request did not. [Note 5] ""[A]n initially consensual encounter between a police officer and a citizen can
Page 175
be transformed into a seizure or detention within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, 'if, in view of all the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.' "" Immigration & Naturalization Serv. v. Delgado, supra at 215, quoting United States v. Mendenhall, supra at 554 (opinion of Stewart, J.). See Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 19 n.16 (1968). Rights under art. 14 of the Declaration of Rights of the Constitution of the Commonwealth are similarly implicated. See Commonwealth v. Stoute, supra at 785-786. Such a transformation can occur if the target of the inquiry refuses to answer and the ""police take additional steps . . . to obtain an answer."" Immigration & Naturalization Serv. v. Delgado, supra at 216. Here, after the defendant broke eye contact with McDermott and refused to respond to the first request, McDermott stepped out of his cruiser and pursued the defendant. In Commonwealth v. Thibeau, 384 Mass. 762 , 764 (1981), we stated that ""[s]tops provoke constitutional scrutiny because they encumber one's freedom of movement. Pursuit that appears designed to effect a stop is no less intrusive than a stop itself . . . [A] stop starts when pursuit begins.""
The Commonwealth contends that the second ""request"" to stop does not transform the request into a seizure because the request was not ""sufficiently intimidating."" We disagree. The second request must be considered ""in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident."" United States v. Mendenhall, supra at 554 (opinion of Stewart, J.). Although the uncommunicated subjective intent of the officer in attempting to effectuate a stop is irrelevant in the Mendenhall analysis [Note 6], the fact that the officer pursued the defendant by leaving his cruiser and walking up to him after being rebuffed is highly relevant
Page 176
determining whether a reasonable person, in view of all the circumstances, would have felt free to terminate the encounter and leave. Moreover, when McDermott pointed at the defendant in the presence of two other officers and said: ""Hey you. I wanna talk to you. Come here"" (emphasis added), he was communicating what a reasonable person would understand as a command that would be enforced by the police power. See Commonwealth v. Stoute, supra at 790 (""We need not decide whether pursuit commenced when the officers drove after the defendant or [a more likely alternative] when Officer Murphy made his second request to the defendant to stop"" [emphasis added]). Evidence that the defendant did in fact stop suggests that he believed, as would any reasonable person, that he was not free to leave. See State v. Quezada, 141 N.H. 258, 260 (1996) (submission after officer's statement to defendant, ""Hey you, stop,"" indicated that compliance was not optional and was seizure). We conclude, as did the Appeals Court, that the defendant was seized when the officer pursued him and told him, ""Come here.""
3. Reasonable suspicion on the basis on an anonymous tip. The question that remains is whether McDermott, at the time of seizure, had an objectively reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, based on specific and articulable facts. See Commonwealth v. Stoute, supra at 789, citing Terry v. Ohio, supra at 21. Commonwealth v. Lyons, 409 Mass. 16 , 18-19 (1990). See Florida v. J.L., 529 U.S. 266, 271 (2000) (""reasonableness of official suspicion must be measured by what the officers knew before they conducted their search""). The Appeals Court concluded that he did not, and we agree.
""[I]f the police conduct an investigatory stop based on an informant's tip, our evaluation of the tip's indicia of reliability will be focused on the informant's reliability and his or her basis of knowledge. Independent police corroboration may make up for deficiencies in one or both of these factors."" Commonwealth v. Lyons, supra at 19. The tip, and McDermott's corroboration of the defendant's identity, did not provide suf-
Page 177
ficient indicia of reliability for suspecting that the defendant had a handgun [Note 7]. See Florida v. J.L., supra at 272 (""An accurate description of a subject's readily observable location and appearance . . . will help police correctly identify the person whom the tipster means to accuse. Such a tip, however, does not show that the tipster has knowledge of concealed criminal activity""). Moreover, even if the tip were reliable, McDermott still did not have reasonable suspicion that the defendant was doing anything illegal to justify seizure, and nothing in this record indicates that McDermott made any observations to support reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. As we said in Commonwealth v. Alvarado, 423 Mass. 266 , 269 (1996), ""[c]arrying a gun is not a crime. Carrying a firearm without a license (or other authorization) is. G. L. c. 269, s. 10 (a)."" An anonymous tip that someone is carrying a gun does not, without more, constitute reasonable suspicion to conduct a stop and frisk of that individual [Note 8]. See Commonwealth v. Couture, 407 Mass. 178 , 183, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 951 (1990) (""mere possession of a
Page 178
handgun was not sufficient to give rise to a reasonable suspicion that the defendant was illegally carrying that gun"") [Note 9].
The Commonwealth argues that, assuming arguendo, the tip did not provide the requisite reasonable suspicion, we should consider the defendant's suspicious activities, including his breaking eye contact with the officer and his refusing to answer the officer's initial questions. Such factors cannot provide reasonable suspicion for justification of a detention or seizure. It was the defendant's right to ignore the officer. See Commonwealth v. Silva, 366 Mass. 402 , 406-407 (1974). As we stated in Commonwealth v. Thibeau, supra at 764, ""[an officer's] suspicion must be reasonable before the [stop] begins. Were the rule otherwise, the police could turn a hunch into a reasonable suspicion by inducing the conduct justifying the suspicion [Note 10].""
The order denying the defendant's motion to suppress is vacated and an order shall be entered allowing that motion. The judgments of conviction are reversed.

"COMMONWEALTH vs. ALFONSO A., a j","Search and Seizure, Affidavit, Warrant. Constitutional Law, Waiver of constitutional rights, Parent and child. Waiver.
A Superior Court judge properly denied a motion to suppress physical evidence seized from a juvenile by the police during the execution of a search warrant, where the affidavit on which the warrant was based relied on the report of a person whose identity and whereabouts were both known; where there was no suggestion that the crime to which the informant heard the juvenile admit involved events that had occurred in a public place or had attracted any kind of notoriety; and where, read in a commonsense fashion, the similarity between the crime and the confession overheard by the informant provided an adequate basis to treat the informant's report as reliable. [373-379]
The record of a hearing on a fifteen year old juvenile's motion to suppress his statements to police did not demonstrate that the police provided the juvenile with a genuine opportunity to consult with an interested adult prior to waiving his constitutional rights; further, while the fact that the juvenile had asserted his rights was important, and could, in combination with other evidence adduced at the hearing, support a finding of a requisite intelligence, experience, knowledge, or sophistication on the part of the juvenile, this court chose to remand the matter to the motion judge for findings with respect to whether this juvenile had sufficient intelligence, experience, knowledge, or sophistication to make a knowing and intelligent waiver of his rights without being given an opportunity to consult with an interested adult.

Kenneth J. King for the juvenile.","SOSMAN, J. The juvenile was adjudicated a delinquent on a complaint charging possession of a firearm. [Note 1] On appeal, the juvenile claimed that his motion to suppress physical evidence and his motion to suppress statements were erroneously denied. The Appeals Court reversed, opining that both motions to suppress should have been allowed. Commonwealth v. Alfonso A., 53 Mass. App. Ct. 279 , 295 (2001). We granted the Commonwealth's application for further appellate review. For the following reasons, we conclude that the motion to suppress physical evidence was properly denied, and that further findings are required with respect to the motion to suppress the juvenile's statements. We therefore remand the matter for further proceedings.
1. Motion to suppress physical evidence. On January 28, 1999, the police executed a search warrant at 21 Montvale Avenue in the Roslindale section of Boston, seizing three twelve-gauge shotguns, two twenty-gauge shotguns, and a pellet gun. The warrant was based on the affidavit of an experienced Boston police detective. The affidavit recited the following facts.
Within the two hours preceding the preparation of the affidavit, the detective had received information from a source whose whereabouts and identity were known to the detective but who wished to remain anonymous. The informant stated that he had ""observed six rifles, three shotguns, two rifles, and one air pellet rifle"" at the 21 Montvale Street address. There were two persons then at the house. The informant knew their first names (""Ricky"" and the juvenile, whom we refer to by the pseudonym ""Alfonso""), but no last names. He reported that ""Ricky"" lived in the house with his parents, but did not think that the parents were presently in the house. ""Alfonso"" had stated ""that he took the guns in a Breaking & Entering on the
Page 374
27th of January, 1999, in West Roxbury."" In fact, the detective knew that there had been a break-in at 24 Chestnut Street in the West Roxbury section of Boston, on that date (which was the day prior to the informant's report), in which three twelve-gauge shotguns, two twenty-gauge shotguns, and a pellet gun had been taken. The informant reported that ""Ricky"" was going to put the guns in a black bag and store them in the garage. Meanwhile, ""Alfonso"" was making phone calls to find a buyer for the weapons. ""Alfonso's"" asking price was $300 to $400 a weapon. According to the informant, ""Alfonso"" had scheduled a meeting later that night with two individuals for a possible sale of the weapons. Based on that information, the detective sought and obtained a warrant to search the premises for ""6 rifles, black bag, drugs and drug paraphernalia."" [Note 2]
The juvenile contends that the information from the informant failed to satisfy either prong of the ""two pronged test"" of Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108 (1964), and Spinelli v. United States, 393 U.S. 410 (1969). See Commonwealth v. Upton, 394 Mass. 363 , 374-376 (1985). Like the Appeals Court, we readily conclude that the affidavit satisfied the ""basis of knowledge"" prong of the Aguilar-Spinelli test. Commonwealth v. Alfonso A., supra at 281-282. In context, it is apparent that the informant was reporting his own observation of the guns in question (describing the specific types and number of weapons he had seen, and the nature, color, and location of the container in which they were being placed) and his own overhearing of both the juvenile's admission as to how he had obtained the guns (including the date and location of the break-in) and the juvenile's telephone calls seeking to arrange sales of the guns (including such details as prices and the approximate time of a planned meeting with some potential purchasers). The affidavit expressly states that the informant ""observed"" the guns, and the level of detail provided is consistent with personal observation, not mere recitation of a casual rumor. See Commonwealth v. Welch, 420 Mass. 646 , 651-652 (1995) (level of detail permits
Page 375
inference that informant ""had direct knowledge""); Commonwealth v. Robinson, 403 Mass. 163 , 165 (1988), quoting Spinelli v. United States, supra at 416 (""it is especially important that the tip describe the accused's criminal activity in sufficient detail that the magistrate may know that he is relying on something more substantial than a casual rumor circulating in the underworld or an accusation based merely on an individual's general reputation"").
With regard to his conclusion that the veracity prong of the Aguilar- Spinelli test had been satisfied, the motion judge relied on the extent of detail in the informant's information, police corroboration of a portion of that detail, and police knowledge of the identity and whereabouts of the informant. In combination, those factors provided sufficient reason to treat the informant's information as reliable. While we must, of necessity, parse each of the items proffered as evidence of the informant's reliability, we must simultaneously bear in mind that the Aguilar-Spinelli test is not to be applied ""hypertechnically."" Commonwealth v. Upton, supra at 374. Rather, we consider whether, taken as a whole and read in a commonsense fashion, the affidavit adequately demonstrates that the informant has provided reliable information. See Commonwealth v. Germain, 396 Mass. 413 , 418 (1985), quoting United States v. Ventresca, 380 U.S. 102, 108-109 (1965) (search warrant affidavit should be interpreted ""in a commonsense and realistic fashion"").
The informant here was not anonymous. The police knew his ""identity"" and his ""whereabouts."" Although the informant was not named in the affidavit, [Note 3] he was not an untraceable, unknown source. See Commonwealth v. Va Meng Joe, 425 Mass. 99 , 103-104 (1997) (informant ""reachable by authorities""); Commonwealth v. Welch, 420 Mass. 646 , 651 (1995) (police ""would be able to contact"" informant); Commonwealth v. Bakoian, 412 Mass. 295 , 301 (1992), quoting Commonwealth v. Atchue, 393 Mass. 343 , 347 (1984) (""identification of the instant informant
Page 376
to the police strengthened his or her credibility and 'carrie[d] with it indicia of reliability of the informant' ""); Commonwealth v. Cast, 407 Mass. 891 , 898-899 (1990) (informant met with Federal agents and gave telephone number at which he was later reached); Commonwealth v. Love, 56 Mass. App. Ct. 229 , 232-234 (2002), and cases cited. [Note 4] Although police knowledge of the informant's ""identity"" and ""whereabouts"" would not be adequate standing alone to confirm the informant's reliability, it is a factor that weighs in favor of reliability.
The information provided was detailed. As discussed above, the details provided by the informant pertained to many aspects of what he had heard and seen. As to the contraband itself, the informant gave details of the number and type of guns seen, the nature of the container in which they were being placed, and the precise location where they were being stored. He identified, albeit by first name only, the two persons there, indicating that it was the home of one of them. He provided detail of how and when the guns had been obtained, i.e., by way of a break-in in West Roxbury the day before. He identified that one of the named occupants of the house was making telephone calls to locate a buyer for the guns; he knew the price being asked; and he knew of a planned meeting that night with two potential buyers. See Commonwealth v. Va Meng Joe, supra at 103, and cases cited. While we agree with the Appeals Court that detail, by itself, does not ordinarily suffice to establish reliability, Commonwealth v. Alfonso A., supra at 284, citing Commonwealth v. Oliveira, 35 Mass. App. Ct. 645 , 648 (1993), [Note 5] it remains a factor in the over-all assessment of the informant's reliability. See
Page 377
Commonwealth v. Aarhus, 387 Mass. 735 , 744 (1982) (""precise description of the location of the knife from an informant known to the authorities tended to demonstrate the reliability of his information"").
Here, a critical component of the detail provided by the known informant was corroborated by police knowledge of the break-in the day before. While detail alone does not confirm the informant's reliability (see note 5, supra), police corroboration of that detail is a strong indicator of reliability. See Commonwealth v. Alfonso A., supra at 284-286, and cases cited. The informant's description of the weapons, and the reported admission by the juvenile that they had been taken during a break-in the previous day at a location in West Roxbury, matched the weapons that the police knew had been taken during a break-in at 24 Chestnut Street, West Roxbury, on that date.
The juvenile argues that the number of weapons did not match, interpreting the affidavit as describing twelve guns possessed by ""Ricky"" and ""Alfonso,"" as compared with the six guns taken in the West Roxbury incident known to the police. The juvenile misinterprets the plain meaning of the affidavit. The affidavit refers to the informant observing ""six rifles,"" which are then more precisely described as ""three shotguns, two rifles, and one air pellet rifle."" If, as the juvenile contends, the ""six rifles"" are in addition to the ""three shotguns, two rifles, and one air pellet rifle,"" there would not be any separate reference to both ""six rifles"" and ""two rifles"" -- that category of weapons would have been described simply as ""eight rifles."" Without needing to dissect the grammar and punctuation of the affidavit, the application itself, in support of which the affidavit was submitted, unambiguously requested issuance of a warrant to search for ""6 rifles,"" not twelve rifles. The number of weapons seen by the informant matched the number of weapons taken in the previous day's break-in.
The types of weapons were also consistent. Although the victim of the break-in had reported the stolen weapons as three
Page 378
twelve-gauge shotguns, two twenty-gauge shotguns, and one pellet gun, the informant's characterization of the two twenty-gauge shotguns as ""rifles,"" while characterizing the three twelve-gauge shotguns as ""shotguns,"" is not a discrepancy of any significance. The critical feature is not the technical differences between ""rifles"" and ""shotguns,"" but the fact that the informant saw three ""shotguns"" of one type, two ""rifles"" of another type, plus one ""air pellet rifle."" That description is a reasonably accurate account of the number and types of weapons taken in the previous day's break-in. Of course, the date of the break-in, and the location of the break-in, were also accurate.
The Appeals Court likened this case to that of Commonwealth v. Upton, 390 Mass. 562 , 572-573 (1983), rev'd, 466 U.S. 727 (1984), S.C., 394 Mass. 363 , 374 (1985), where an unknown woman telephoned the police with information, part of which pertained to a police search that had recently occurred in a motel. While the anonymous and untraceable informant in that case gave a report consistent with what the police knew of that search, corroboration of something that had happened in a public place carried little significance, as anyone could have known those same details. We do not see the cases as similar. As discussed above, the present affidavit did not rely on an anonymous telephone report, but on the report of a person whose ""identity"" and ""whereabouts"" were both known. Nor is there any suggestion here that the break-in to which the informant heard the juvenile admit, which matched the break-in known to the police, involved events that had occurred in a public place. There is also no reason to believe that the break-in in West Roxbury had attracted any kind of notoriety or newsworthiness that would have made the precise details common knowledge by the very next day, nor any reason to believe that the informant was affiliated with or known to the victim of the break-in, such that he could have known the date, location, and exact items stolen through conversation with the victim. Read in a commonsense fashion, the ""match"" between the previous day's break-in and the confession overheard by the informant, combined with the weapons seen by the informant, provided an adequate basis to treat the informant's report as reliable.
We therefore conclude that the motion judge properly denied
Page 379
the motion to suppress physical evidence seized during the execution of the search warrant.
2. Motion to suppress statements. The juvenile also moved to suppress statements he had made to the police. The facts found by the motion judge, as amplified by uncontested evidence presented at the hearing, are as follows.
In anticipation of the search warrant, four or five police officers went to 21 Montvale Street and secured the second-floor residence. Present were Richard McMann (Ricky), two other young adult men, and the juvenile. The police ascertained that the two other young men had outstanding default warrants. They were arrested and removed from the scene. The juvenile and Ricky remained at the residence with the officers. As part of the preliminary inquiry and patfrisk of the juvenile, the juvenile indicated that he had been arrested two times before, including on a charge of robbery. The officers then waited at the apartment with the juvenile and Ricky for some two and one-half hours before the search warrant arrived. During that wait, Ricky's mother, stepfather, and older brother returned home to the apartment. The adults stayed in the kitchen. Ricky and the juvenile were kept seated on a couch in the living room. At one point, when the juvenile needed to use the bathroom, a detective accompanied him. It was apparent that the juvenile and Ricky were not free to leave.
When the police received word that the search warrant had been approved and was on the way, they decided to question Ricky and the juvenile. They took Ricky into a bedroom to question him separately. As they went, Ricky's mother asked whether she could be present during the interview. The police told her that, because Ricky was an adult (he was eighteen years old at the time), it was Ricky's choice whether to have anyone else present. Ricky announced that he did not want his mother to accompany him. This exchange took place in the presence of the juvenile and was presumably overheard by him.
After completing the questioning of Ricky, two detectives next took the juvenile into the bedroom. They asked him his date of birth, which was November 14, 1983, making the juvenile fifteen years old at the time. One of the detectives then read the juvenile his Miranda warnings. He asked the juvenile
Page 380
whether he understood his rights, and specifically asked him if he was aware of those rights as a result of his previous arrests. The juvenile stated that he was aware of his rights. After giving the juvenile his Miranda warnings, the detective asked the juvenile if he wanted them to contact or get his mother and have her present during the interview. [Note 6] In the alternative, the detective asked the juvenile if he wanted to consult with some other adult, indicating that Ricky's mother and two other adults were in the kitchen. The juvenile stated that he did not want his mother present and did not want to consult with any adult. The detective repeated the offer two more times. The juvenile again declined the offers, stating that he did not want anyone else present. The juvenile then waived his rights and gave a statement in which he admitted to the West Roxbury break-in the day before and confirmed the presence of the stolen guns being held at the 21 Montvale Avenue residence. He stated that he had committed the break-in along with other participants, but he refused to give the names of those other perpetrators.
For purposes of establishing a valid waiver by a juvenile under the age of fourteen years, we require the Commonwealth to show ""that a parent or an interested adult was present, understood the warnings, and had the opportunity to explain his rights to the juvenile so that the juvenile understands the significance of waiver of these rights."" Commonwealth v. A Juvenile, 389 Mass. 128 , 134 (1983). However, where a juvenile is fourteen years of age or older, the rule is more flexible: ""[T]here should ordinarily be a meaningful consultation with the parent, interested adult, or attorney to ensure that the waiver is knowing and intelligent. For a waiver to be valid without such a consultation the circumstances should demonstrate a high degree of intelligence, experience, knowledge, or sophistication on the part of the juvenile."" Id. The court later clarified that actual consultation between the juvenile and a parent, interested adult, or attorney was not required, as long as there was a ""genuine opportunity"" for such consultation. Commonwealth v. MacNeill, 399 Mass. 71 , 78 (1987). ""It is the
Page 381
juvenile's opportunity to consult that is critical, not whether he avails himself of it."" Id. ""So long as the juvenile is at least fourteen and has the opportunity for a meaningful consultation, the juvenile may make a valid waiver without actual consultation."" Commonwealth v. Berry, 410 Mass. 31 , 35 (1991). ""[T]he ultimate question is whether the juvenile has understood his rights and the potential consequences of waiving them before talking to the police. The choice of a sixteen year old juvenile not to consult with an available friendly advisor concerning those matters suggests that the juvenile's understanding was such that consultation was unnecessary."" Commonwealth v. MacNeill, supra at 79. To date, we have not imposed specific requirements regarding the precise nature of the juvenile's ""opportunity"" for consultation. See Commonwealth v. Philip S., 414 Mass. 804 , 811 n.5 (1993) (officers not required to recommend that juvenile and adult discuss juvenile's rights during their opportunity to confer); Commonwealth v. Ward, 412 Mass. 395 , 397 (1992) (police not required expressly to advise juvenile and adult that they may confer privately).
The motion judge ruled that the repeated offers to get the juvenile's mother and have her present at the interview, and the alternative offers to have one of the other adults in the apartment be present, gave the juvenile a ""meaningful opportunity to consult with an adult."" We agree with the juvenile that the offers made here did not amount to the ""genuine opportunity"" for consultation required by our cases. Commonwealth v. MacNeill, supra at 78. While we have never expressly held that the adult in question must be physically present in order for there to be that ""genuine opportunity"" for consultation, an adult was in fact present in all of the cases where we have found that there was the required ""opportunity"" for consultation. See Commonwealth v. McCra, 427 Mass. 564 , 565-566 (1998); Commonwealth v. Hogan, 426 Mass. 424 , 430-431 (1998); Commonwealth v. Philip S., supra at 811-812; Commonwealth v. Ward, supra; Commonwealth v. Berry, supra at 33; Commonwealth v. Tevenal, 401 Mass. 225 , 227 (1987); Commonwealth v. MacNeill, supra at 75. We have also noted that, in order for there to be any genuine consultation, the adult who is
Page 382
available to the juvenile must be informed of and understand the juvenile's constitutional rights. See Commonwealth v. Berry, supra at 34-35; Commonwealth v. Guyton, 405 Mass. 497 , 502 n.1 (1989). That requirement connotes the presence of an adult, or, at the very least, contact between the adult and the police so that the police may inform the adult of those rights.
For purposes of deciding the present case, we need not rule out the possibility that something less than actual physical presence of the adult might suffice (e.g., interested adult participating through speaker telephone). Here, the repeated offers to get the juvenile's mother did not, in a practical sense, provide the juvenile with the protection that is envisioned by the requirement that the juvenile have an opportunity to consult with an adult. The ""genuine opportunity"" for consultation that our cases envision is not merely a theoretical opportunity, that the juvenile may utilize at some future time, but an opportunity that is immediately and evidently available to the juvenile before the juvenile waives his or her rights. The detectives had already advised the juvenile of his rights, and obtained his confirmation that he understood those rights, before mentioning anything about contacting his mother. In context, it was apparent that the detectives were ready to proceed then and there, and the juvenile would, in effect, need to assert his rights in order to interrupt the interrogation and await his mother's arrival. The very purpose of our rules pertaining to the opportunity for consultation with an adult is because ""most juveniles do not understand the significance and protective function of these rights even when they are read the standard Miranda warnings,"" they ""frequently lack the capacity to appreciate the consequences of their actions,"" and the opportunity for consultation with an adult ""prevent[s] the warnings from becoming merely a ritualistic recitation wherein the effect of actual comprehension by the juvenile is ignored."" Commonwealth v. A Juvenile, 389 Mass. 128 , 131, 132 (1983). If the juvenile needs to assert his rights in order to obtain the benefit of any consultation with an adult, the purpose behind the requirement is nullified.
We also agree with the Appeals Court's observation that ""a juvenile in trouble may be embarrassed to ask for an adult's help,"" Commonwealth v. Alfonso A., 53 Mass. App. Ct. 279 ,
Page 383
293 (2001), and the presentation of the ostensible ""opportunity"" to consult with his mother placed this juvenile in the posture of having affirmatively to ask for that help (and then wait for that help to arrive). There is too great a risk that a juvenile will engage in a show of bravado rather than admit to any desire or need to consult with an adult. [Note 7] When the adult is present and immediately available, the juvenile may still decline to consult with that adult, but there is at least no additional pragmatic barrier to consultation that the juvenile must overcome. Here, there was such a barrier, that many juveniles would be hard pressed to overcome. The offer to get the juvenile's mother, no matter how many times it was made, did not present this juvenile with a ""genuine opportunity"" to consult with her.
We also agree with the Appeals Court's analysis that the offer to allow the juvenile to consult with any of the other adults present in the apartment did not provide the juvenile an opportunity to consult with an ""interested adult."" Commonwealth v. Alfonso A., supra at 293. Our cases have not required that the adult with whom the juvenile has an opportunity to consult literally be a parent of the juvenile. See Commonwealth v. McCra, supra at 568-569 (aunt); Commonwealth v. Hogan, supra at 430-431 (grandmother); Commonwealth v. MacNeill, supra at 77-78 (grandfather). The adult must, however, be someone with a relationship with the juvenile who ""is sufficiently interested in the juvenile's welfare to afford the juvenile appropriate protection."" Id. See Commonwealth v. A Juvenile, 389 Mass. 128 , 134 (1983) (characterizing interested adult as ""someone in loco parentis""). [Note 8] Here, there was no information suggesting any close relationship between the juvenile and any of the adults then in the apartment. The juvenile knew Ricky's mother from occasional visits with her son, but Ricky's mother understandably
Page 384
testified at the hearing that the juvenile was ""not [her] responsibility."" There was no showing that the juvenile even knew any of the other adults in the apartment. And, while those adults were more readily at hand than the juvenile's mother, the detective's offer to allow the juvenile to consult with them still left it to the juvenile affirmatively to interrupt the interrogation and request such assistance. None of those adults was present in the room, and none of them had been advised of the Miranda warnings. They were not in any position -- lacking the requisite relationship with the juvenile, immediate presence, and awareness of the juvenile's rights -- to provide him with guidance as to any waiver of his rights.
We thus conclude that this juvenile was not accorded any ""genuine opportunity"" to consult with an ""interested adult"" prior to waiving his constitutional rights. Where the juvenile had no such opportunity, the Commonwealth must make the alternative showing of ""circumstances [demonstrating] a high degree of intelligence, experience, knowledge, or sophistication on the part of the juvenile."" Commonwealth v. A Juvenile, 389 Mass. 128 , 134 (1983). Our ability to address this alternative is hampered by the fact that the motion judge made no findings on this issue, having decided (erroneously) that there had been an adequate opportunity to consult with an interested adult. The Appeals Court concluded that the record was insufficient to support any finding of the requisite ""intelligence, experience, knowledge or sophistication,"" and therefore concluded, without any remand for further findings, that the motion to suppress statements should have been allowed. Commonwealth v. Alfonso A., supra at 294, quoting Commonwealth v. A Juvenile, 389 Mass. 128 , 134 (1983). We disagree.
The record reflects that the juvenile had been arrested twice before, including one arrest on a robbery charge and the other on an unidentified misdemeanor. While there was no specificity as to what warnings he had been given in the course of those prior encounters with the juvenile justice system, at least some familiarity with that system can be inferred, [Note 9] and the juvenile acknowledged that he was familiar with his rights by way of
Page 385
that prior involvement with the police. Of greatest importance is the fact that, during questioning, this juvenile actually asserted his right to remain silent. The juvenile admitted his involvement in the previous day's break-in, and acknowledged that the crime had been perpetrated ""with other people,"" but he refused to tell the officers who those ""other people"" were. The juvenile's actual assertion of his rights is the strongest indication possible that the juvenile was indeed aware of and understood those rights and was capable, on his own, of asserting them. Thus, for example, in Commonwealth v. King, 17 Mass. App. Ct. 602 , 609-610 (1984), where the juvenile was not given an opportunity to consult with an adult, the juvenile's prior involvement with the courts coupled with his assertion of his right to an attorney during a recent interrogation sufficed to support the judge's conclusion that the juvenile had sufficient experience, knowledge, or sophistication. Here, while the juvenile's prior involvement with the courts is less than that of the juvenile in Commonwealth v. King, supra, the cases have the same critical factor in common: the juvenile's proven ability to assert his rights when he wanted to do so. See Commonwealth v. Pucillo, 427 Mass. 108 , 111 (1998) (finding of valid waiver supported by fact that juvenile ""had successfully invoked his right to silence earlier in the evening""). See also Commonwealth v. Mandile, 397 Mass. 410 , 414 (1986) (adult defendant's awareness of his right to counsel illustrated by fact that he ""exercised that right prior to giving his statement"").
While the fact that the juvenile asserted his rights is important, and could, in combination with other evidence adduced at the hearing, support a finding of the requisite intelligence, experience, knowledge, or sophistication, it is not for this court to make that finding. The record permits it, but it does not compel it. There is some contrary evidence (for example, the juvenile's extremely poor performance in school) that must be weighed against the evidence that would support the finding. And, of course, the motion judge had the opportunity to observe the juvenile (although the juvenile did not
Page 386
testify at the hearing). We therefore remand the matter for the judge's findings with respect to whether this juvenile had sufficient intelligence, experience, knowledge, or sophistication to make a knowing and intelligent waiver of his rights without being given an opportunity to consult with an interested adult.

Information relayed by a police radio dispatcher was sufficient to warrant a traffic stop, where the dispatcher had recognized or had reasonably believed that a cellular telephone caller was a certain reserve police officer known to the dispatcher, and as a result the dispatcher could have considered as reliable information he received from the caller and relayed to the police officer who stopped the vehicle, regarding the reckless operation of the vehicle.

Page 614
and ordered judgment entered for the defendant. Commonwealth v. Riggieri, 53 Mass. App. Ct. 373 (2001). We granted the Commonwealth's application for further appellate review. Because we conclude that the police officer had sufficient justification for initiating a traffic stop of the defendant's vehicle, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.
1. Facts. We briefly recite the facts as found by the motion judge, supplemented by undisputed testimony from the motion hearing where necessary. On September 6, 1998, at approximately 1:30 A.M., Officer Richard Haley of the Westborough police department was alerted by a dispatcher to be on the look out for an automobile being driven erratically. The dispatcher relayed information to Officer Haley describing the make, model, and registration number of the vehicle.
The information regarding the automobile was reported by a cellular telephone caller to the Westborough police dispatcher. Officer Haley testified that while moving his cruiser to a position that would allow him to view the route traveled by the automobile, he received regular updates from the dispatcher regarding the progress of the vehicle. According to Officer Haley, the dispatcher identified the cellular telephone caller as an off-duty reserve Westborough police officer. [Note 2] The off-duty reserve officer, identified in the record as Officer McLaughlin, apparently followed the defendant for some distance, updating the dispatcher as to the location and progression of the automobile. [Note 3]
Shortly after the initial telephone call to the dispatcher, Officer Haley observed the automobile and followed the defendant
Page 615
approximately 400 yards before initiating a traffic stop. Officer Haley did not observe the defendant commit any traffic violations; in stopping the defendant he relied totally on the information from the dispatcher. Almost immediately after Officer Haley pulled over the defendant, McLaughlin arrived at the scene in his personal automobile.
2. Discussion. The defendant contends that because Officer Haley did not have information sufficient to allow a threshold inquiry, all of the information gathered subsequent to the stop should be suppressed. The sole issue on appeal is whether the information the dispatcher relayed to Officer Haley was sufficiently reliable to warrant a traffic stop. ""A police officer may stop a vehicle in order to conduct a threshold inquiry if he has a reasonable suspicion that the occupants have committed, are committing, or are about to commit a crime. His suspicion must be based on specific, articulable facts and reasonable inferences drawn therefrom. A hunch will not suffice."" Commonwealth v. Wren, 391 Mass. 705 , 707 (1984), and cases cited. In this case, Officer Haley had no independent basis for his decision to conduct a threshold inquiry of the defendant. He relied completely on the description from the dispatcher regarding the driver's alleged reckless driving.
When a police officer initiates a stop on the basis of radio dispatch information, ""the Commonwealth must present evidence at the hearing on the motion to suppress on the factual basis for the police radio call in order to establish its indicia of reliability."" Commonwealth v. Cheek, 413 Mass. 492 , 494-495 (1992), and cases cited. The Appeals Court held that the Commonwealth failed to show that the information received by Officer Haley was from a reliable informant. Commonwealth v. Riggieri, 53 Mass. App. Ct. 373 , 375-376 (2001). That being the case, the court held that Officer Haley lacked reasonable suspicion for a threshold inquiry, and as a result the evidence obtained should have been suppressed. Id. at 376-377. We disagree.
""[I]f the police conduct an investigatory stop based on an informant's tip, our evaluation of the tip's indicia of reliability will be focused on the informant's reliability and his or her basis of knowledge. Independent police corroboration may make
Page 616
up for deficiencies in one or both of these factors."" Commonwealth v. Barros, 435 Mass. 171 , 176 (2001), quoting Commonwealth v. Lyons, 409 Mass. 16 , 19 (1990). We recognize that officers in the field may rely on flyers, bulletins, or radio information coming from dispatchers and fellow officers in conducting a threshold inquiry of a suspect. See United States v. Hensley, 469 U.S. 221, 232-233 (1985). ""If a flyer or bulletin has been issued on the basis of articulable facts supporting a reasonable suspicion that the wanted person has committed an offense, then reliance on that flyer or bulletin justifies a stop to check identification . . . to pose questions to the person, or to detain the person briefly while attempting to obtain further information"" (citation omitted). Id. at 232. This court has also recognized that this principle is ""equally applicable where information is transmitted between officers by radio rather than by a wanted flyer."" Commonwealth v. Fraser, 410 Mass. 541 , 546 (1991). Because Officer Haley did not personally witness any driving infractions or other events that would corroborate the dispatcher's information, this case turns on the reliability of the dispatcher's information at the time Officer Haley effectuated the stop. Because the dispatcher received the information from a cellular caller, we will focus on the caller's basis of knowledge and reliability. [Note 4]
The main focus of inquiry in this case deals with the cellular telephone caller's reliability as a citizen informant. [Note 5] Far from being an anonymous informant, McLaughlin was a reserve member of the Westborough police force. While there may not be sufficient evidence to show that, prior to the stop, Officer Haley himself knew that the informant was actually McLaughlin, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence adduced at the suppression hearing to show that the dispatcher could
Page 617
reasonably have found the caller a reliable informant. While neither McLaughlin nor the dispatcher testified at the hearing, Officer Haley recounted the bulletin he received over the police radio. The judge found that ""an off duty police officer, known to the dispatcher, was following the vehicle in question."" We conclude that the motion judge correctly made the inference that the dispatcher knew, or reasonably believed, the cellular telephone caller to be off-duty Reserve Officer McLaughlin.
The obvious concern here is the potential for a situation where an anonymous caller impersonates an off-duty police officer. We believe, in this case, that that concern is unwarranted. Here, the testimony of Officer Haley indicated that McLaughlin was in fact the cellular telephone caller. [Note 6] This point, however, is not relevant to the ultimate disposition of this case. What is relevant is whether the dispatcher reasonably credited the cellular telephone informant as a reliable source that would allow for a threshold inquiry. We conclude that the record contained sufficient proof for the motion judge to determine that the dispatcher recognized or reasonably believed the informant to be Reserve Officer McLaughlin. [Note 7] The record permits the reasonable inference that the dispatcher recognized the cellular telephone caller as Reserve Officer McLaughlin (especially given his regular updates), and as a result could consider the information regarding the reckless operation of the automobile reliable. Thus, the information received by dispatch and relayed to Officer Haley was sufficiently reliable to satisfy the less rigorous requirement necessary for an officer to conduct a threshold inquiry. See Commonwealth v. Lyons, supra. Because the stop of the defendant was justified, the subsequent evidence gathered by Officer Haley was properly admitted at trial.

A Superior Court judge properly determined that an initial warrantless entry by police officers and the subsequent search of the criminal defendant's apartment for occupants was not permissible where, although the police officers clearly had a right to control the premises from the outside until a search warrant was obtained, they had no basis for believing that immediate entry was necessary to prevent the destruction of evidence, absent any indication whatsoever that the dwelling was occupied at the time; and where an officer easily could have been stationed at the door to secure the apartment while another proceeded to obtain a warrant. [619-621, 622-624]
This court concluded that police officers who secure a dwelling while a warrant is being sought in order to prevent destruction or removal of evidence may not enter that dwelling, in the absence of specific information supporting an objectively reasonable belief that evidence will indeed be removed or destroyed unless preventative measures are taken. [621-622]
A Superior Court judge erred in excluding evidence seized from the apartment of a criminal defendant during a search conducted pursuant to a warrant that had been issued based upon an affidavit describing cocaine and drug paraphernalia observed in plain view by police officers during the course of an initial illegal warrantless entry of the apartment where, after striking from a supporting affidavit a reference to the drugs and paraphernalia observed during the initial illegal search, the cumulative information remaining in the affidavit provided probable cause to believe that the cocaine and implements used for cocaine distribution would be found in the defendant's apartment.

The Commonwealth appealed from an order entered in the Superior Court suppressing evidence seized by the police during a search of the defendant's apartment. The search was conducted pursuant to a warrant issued, in part, on a description of cocaine and drug paraphernalia observed by police officers during a prior warrantless ""protective sweep"" of the apartment following the defendant's arrest. [Note 1] After an evidentiary hearing, the judge entered a memorandum of decision and order in which he ruled that the evidence must be suppressed because no exigent circumstances excused the officers' failure to obtain a search warrant prior to their initial entry into the defendant's apartment. A single justice of this court granted the Commonwealth leave to file an interlocutory appeal and transmitted the matter to the Appeals Court. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 15 (a)(2), as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 (1996). A divided panel of the Appeals Court concluded that the judge had ruled correctly and affirmed the order allowing the motion to suppress. See Commonwealth v. DeJesus, 56 Mass. App. Ct. 523 (2002). We granted the Commonwealth's application for further appellate review and, for reasons that follow, we now reverse the order suppressing the Commonwealth's evidence.
1. We relate the facts as found by the judge, supplemented by uncontroverted evidence presented at the hearing. On March 29, 1999, the defendant was arrested in a parking lot after a sale of approximately 300 grams of cocaine to an undercover State police officer by one Rocky Graciano. During the sale, the defendant remained in the automobile in which the cocaine was delivered. Graciano, who had been the focus of an investigation by the State police narcotics unit for Essex County into drug activity in the Lawrence area, and one other individual were also arrested. After his arrest, Graciano agreed to cooperate with the police. He informed State Trooper Brian O'Neil that
Page 618
the defendant was his supplier and the defendant had delivered the cocaine used in the drug sale to Graciano at his (Graciano's) home at 5 Forest Street, Lawrence, that same day, on foot. Graciano further stated that he had been involved in numerous drug deals with the defendant, whom he knew lived on Lynch Street in Lawrence. Graciano accompanied several police officers to Lynch Street where he pointed out a light grey, three-story building that had a side entrance displaying the number 7. Graciano stated that he had in the past observed the defendant emerging from that entrance. The police officers ascertained that the entrance led to two apartments, one on the second floor and one on the third floor. Graciano never stated in which of the two apartments the defendant lived or whether anyone else lived with the defendant. In the course of a separate investigation, however, Trooper O'Neil had obtained information from a confidential informant that a third-floor apartment at 7 Lynch Street was a ""stash location"" for a drug operation and the residence of ""two individuals involved in cocaine distribution.""
Obtaining keys taken from the defendant at the time of his arrest, Trooper O'Neil and another officer then proceeded to 7 Lynch Street to determine, in his words, ""if, in fact, those keys would access the . . . door that [Graciano] had pointed out to me. I did that and those keys did, in fact unlock that door."" He then went to the third-floor apartment, knocked loudly, and announced that it was the police. There was no response. Again using the keys taken from the defendant, Trooper O'Neil found that one key ""did, in fact, fit and operate the lock[]."" On gaining entry, the officers ""yelled into the apartment that it was the police"" and ""checked the rooms"" to see whether anyone was inside. In the process, they observed cocaine and cocaine packing equipment in plain view on the kitchen table. Finding the apartment unoccupied, the officers secured the apartment by locking the door. Leaving officers stationed outside, Trooper O'Neil returned to the drug task force office to prepare an application and supporting affidavit for a search warrant for the defendant's apartment.
In his supporting affidavit, Trooper O'Neil stated that ""potential co-conspirators could be aware of the police detection of Graciano . . . and [the defendant]."" At the suppression
Page 619
hearing, Trooper O'Neil explained that between three and four hours had elapsed since the defendant's arrest and that, in the meantime, he had overheard a woman in Graciano's apartment telling an unknown telephone caller that Graciano had been arrested. Trooper O'Neil then reiterated his belief at the time that ""any occupant of that apartment could be aware that [the defendant] was arrested and remove any evidence or cocaine from that apartment."" The judge found this to be the only evidence offered by the Commonwealth explaining the officers' prior entry into the defendant's apartment. The judge determined that the circumstances presented no ""compelling necessity for immediate action"" and reasoned that ""[a]n officer easily could have been stationed at the door to secure the apartment while Trooper O'Neil proceeded to obtain a search warrant."" The judge in effect concluded that the initial entry by police into the defendant's apartment was unlawful and, accordingly, allowed the motion to suppress the evidence.
2. The first issue before us is whether the police officers' initial warrantless entry and subsequent search of the defendant's apartment for occupants was permissible. We conclude that it was not.
""The right of police officers to enter into a home, for whatever purpose, represents a serious governmental intrusion into one's privacy. It was just this sort of intrusion that the Fourth Amendment [to the United States Constitution and art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights] was designed to circumscribe by the general requirement of a judicial determination of probable cause."" Commonwealth v. Forde, 367 Mass. 798 , 805 (1975). Federal and State case law delineates clear boundaries for permissible entry by police officers into a home in order to search or arrest. In the absence of a warrant, two conditions must be met in order for a nonconsensual entry to be valid: there must be probable cause [Note 2] and there must be exigent circumstances. See Kirk v. Louisiana, 536 U.S. 635, 637-638
Page 620
(2002); Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 478 (1971); Vale v. Louisiana, 399 U.S. 30, 34-35 (1970); Commonwealth v. Paniaqua, 413 Mass. 796 , 798 (1992); Commonwealth v. Pietrass, 392 Mass. 892 , 897 (1984). A reasonable belief as to the potential loss or destruction of evidence may create exigent circumstances permitting a warrantless search and seizure of evidence. See Commonwealth v. Ortiz, 435 Mass. 569 , 572 (2002); Commonwealth v. Martino, 412 Mass. 267 , 276 (1992). The Commonwealth concedes, however, that no such exigent circumstances were present in this case. [Note 3]
The Commonwealth maintains that the police did not need exigent circumstances in order to enter the apartment pending the issuance of a warrant. The Commonwealth characterizes the officer's entry and protective sweep as ""securing"" the premises and argues that it was fully justified by the police officers' need to ensure that no one was inside who might remove or destroy evidence. In support of its position, the Commonwealth cites cases decided under both Federal and State search and seizure jurisprudence recognizing that ""securing"" a dwelling, on the basis of probable cause, in order to prevent the destruction or removal of evidence while a search warrant is being sought, is
Page 621
not by itself an unreasonable search. See Segura v. United States, 468 U.S. 796, 810 (1984); Commonwealth v. Blake, 413 Mass. 823 , 829-830 (1992); Commonwealth v. Yesilciman, 406 Mass. 736 , 743 (1990) (art. 14 permits police to secure area to be searched before warrant is procured so long as the search does not commence before issuance of warrant); Commonwealth v. Voris, 38 Mass. App. Ct. 377 , 381-382 & n.3 (1995).
We have not had occasion to consider whether the authority to secure a dwelling allows police officers to enter a dwelling and conduct a limited search in order to ascertain whether the dwelling is unoccupied. We conclude that there is a fundamental difference between securing or controlling the perimeter of a dwelling from the outside and the entry and physical surveillance of a dwelling from the inside. We now hold that police officers who secure a dwelling while a warrant is being sought in order to prevent destruction or removal of evidence may not enter that dwelling, in the absence of specific information supporting an objectively reasonable belief that evidence will indeed be removed or destroyed unless preventative measures are taken.
We do not interpret Fourth Amendment doctrine to hold otherwise. In Segura v. United States, supra, the United States Supreme Court affirmed the denial of a motion to suppress evidence seized pursuant to a warrant obtained after police officers entered a defendant's apartment and remained there overnight. Id. at 810 (opinion of Burger, C.J.), quoting Katz v. New York, 389 U.S. 347, 351 (1967) (reasoning that the apartment had been seized not searched and that ""the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places""). The procedural and factual posture of the Segura case, however, differed significantly from this one. The Segura Court considered only the limited question whether the Fourth Amendment requires suppression of evidence not observed in plain view on the initial entry. Moreover, the police in Segura entered an apartment known to be occupied by the defendant's girl friend, the codefendant. [Note 4] Id. Only two Justices joined that part of the opinion explaining the
Page 622
Court's holding. Four dissenters objected that ""this seizure was constitutionally unreasonable from the moment it began"" because it ""was conducted without a warrant and in the absence of exigent circumstances."" Id. at 824 (Stevens, J., dissenting).
Significantly, the following excerpt from Segura (the same part joined by but two Justices) appears to assume that the initial entry was illegal: ""[A]bsent exigent circumstances, the entry may have constituted an illegal search, or interference with petitioners' privacy interests, requiring suppression of all evidence observed during the entry. Securing the premises from within, however, was no more an interference with the petitioners' possessory interests in the contents of the apartment than a perimeter 'stakeout.' In other words, the initial entry -- legal or not -- does not affect the reasonableness of the seizure."" Id. at 811 (opinion of Burger, C.J.). After analyzing the reasoning of the Segura decision, a leading commentator in the field of Fourth Amendment protection has concluded that ""it does not appear that the majority really has approved warrantless entry and impoundment even absent truly exigent circumstances."" 3 W.R. LaFave, Search and Seizure § 6.5 (c), at 365 (3d ed. 1996). The commentator recognizes that police may impound premises from the outside without a warrant or exigent circumstances, but unequivocally states: ""If . . . the police make a physical entry into the premises in order to effectuate the impoundment, then there has been both a seizure and a search."" Id. at 366.
On the basis of art. 14, we adhere to that view. An individual's protections guaranteed under art. 14 do not cease at the time of arrest. The Commonwealth asserts that the risk that others knew of the defendant's arrest and that one or more individuals inside his apartment might have removed or destroyed evidence before
Page 623
a warrant issued justified the officers' limited search of the premises for occupants. [Note 5] Adoption of this reasoning, however, would allow police officers to enter a suspect's home every time an arrest is made, so long as police have probable cause to believe that evidence might be found therein. There always will be a possibility that a confederate of the arrestee might destroy or conceal evidence. We decline to hold that an arrest on the street, without more, can provide its own justification for a warrantless entry and search, albeit a limited one, of a dwelling. [Note 6] We conclude that, although the officers clearly had a right to control the premises from the outside until a search warrant was obtained, they had no basis for believing that immediate entry was necessary to prevent the destruction of evidence. For purposes of deciding this case, we need not determine with precision the minimum requirements that would justify such an entry, as the facts and circumstances here lacked an obvious prerequisite. There was no indication whatsoever that the dwelling
Page 624
was occupied at the time -- the officers had no knowledge that anyone was inside, there was no response to their knocking at the door, and they apparently heard no sounds coming from within. [Note 7] By definition, any evidence located within an unoccupied dwelling can be fully protected by controlling access to that dwelling from the outside. There can be no justification for a warrantless entry absent at least an objectively reasonable belief that someone is inside. On the facts of this case, we agree with the judge's determination that ""[a]n officer easily could have been stationed at the door to secure the apartment while Trooper O'Neil proceeded to obtain a search warrant."" [Note 8]
3. Our conclusion that the initial entry and protective sweep was impermissible under art. 14 does not, however, automatically require the exclusion of the evidence. Although the exclusionary rule prohibits the admission of evidence obtained during an illegal search as ""fruit of the poisonous tree,"" evidence initially discovered as a consequence of an unlawful search may be admissible if later acquired independently by lawful means untainted by the initial illegality. See Murray v. United States, 487 U.S. 533, 537-538 (1988); Segura v. United States, supra at 813-814; Commonwealth v. Blake, supra at 830; Commonwealth v. Frodyma, 393 Mass. 438 , 442 (1984), and cases cited. See also Commonwealth v. O'Connor, 406 Mass. 112 , 115 (1989) ( ""principles of deterrence underlying the
Page 625
exclusionary rule will not be undercut by the application of an inevitable discovery exception in the circumstances of this case"").
The Appeals Court correctly recognized that, regardless of the illegality of the initial entry and search, the evidence is admissible as long as the affidavit in support of the application for a search warrant contains information sufficient to establish probable cause to search the defendant's apartment, apart from the observation of the cocaine and cocaine distribution materials. See Commonwealth v. DeJesus, 56 Mass. App. Ct. 523 , 525 n.1 (2002). [Note 9] This analysis is consistent with both precedent and policy. See Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 484 (1963); Commonwealth v. White, 374 Mass. 132 , 139 (1977), aff'd, 439 U.S. 280 (1978); Commonwealth v. Hall, 366 Mass. 790 , 795-797 (1975).
It is a simple matter to exclude from the supporting affidavit all information gained from the initial entry by striking the following sentence concerning observations made while inside the apartment: ""After entering the apartment to conductive [sic] sweep for occupants this officer immediately observed cocaine and cocaine packing equipment on the kitchen table."" What is left relates the information that Graciano had been the subject of an ongoing cocaine investigation by Lawrence drug task force officers ending that day when Graciano and the defendant were arrested after having delivered approximately 300 grams of cocaine to an undercover police officer; Graciano had informed the officers that the defendant was his supplier and had supplied the cocaine for that delivery; the defendant lived in a gray three-story dwelling on Lynch Street, with two front doors, ""the right side front door displaying a [5] next to it and the left front door displaying a 7 next to it""; Graciano knew this because the defendant told him; and Graciano had met the defendant several times in front of the Lynch Street building but had not been inside. In addition, the affidavit stated that ""[w]ithin the past two weeks this officer has received information from a Confidential Reliable Informant regarding a cocaine
Page 626
distribution operation at 7 Lynch Street, floor 3, Lawrence, MA."" The affidavit then described the manner in which police effectuated entry into both the outside door of the building and the inside door to the third-floor apartment, by using keys that were taken from the defendant at his arrest.
An affidavit must contain sufficient information for an issuing magistrate to determine that the items sought are related to the criminal activity under investigation, and that the items reasonably may be expected to be located in the place to be searched at the time the search warrant issues. See Commonwealth v. Wilson, 427 Mass. 336 , 342 (1998). Whether the facts set forth in the affidavit added up to probable cause to support the search involves application of familiar principles expressed in Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108, 114 (1964), and Spinelli v. United States, 393 U.S. 410, 414-415 (1969). See Commonwealth v. Upton, 394 Mass. 363 , 374-375 (1985). Under the Aguilar-Spinelli standard, where information in the affidavit is based, as here, in part on a tip of an unidentified informant, the affidavit must also apprise the magistrate of facts and circumstances showing both (1) the basis of the informant's knowledge; and (2) the credibility of the informant and the reliability of his information. See Commonwealth v. Cast, 407 Mass. 891 , 896 (1990). Although, standing alone, the information contained in the affidavit attributed to ""a Confidential Reliable Informant"" fails on both prongs of this standard, it is well settled that independent police corroboration of the information's tip can compensate for deficiencies in either or both prongs and thus satisfy the probable cause requirement under art. 14. See Commonwealth v. Alvarez, 422 Mass. 198 , 208 (1996); Commonwealth v. Blake, supra at 827, and cases cited; Commonwealth v. Carrasco, 405 Mass. 316 , 321-322 (1989).
Here, the anonymous informant's tip that cocaine would be found at the apartment was fully corroborated by the police investigation leading to the defendant's arrest, as well as by Graciano's statements to police that the defendant was his supplier and that he had, in fact, delivered cocaine that day. The only information not so corroborated was the description of the premises to be searched as the third-floor apartment at 7 Lynch Street (rather than the second-floor apartment of the same
Page 627
building). Any defect under the Aguilar-Spinelli standard with respect to this information, however, was cured by the recitation, in the affidavit, of police use of the keys seized from the defendant to unlock both the outside door of 7 Lynch Street and the inside door to the third-floor apartment. [Note 10] That the keys fit the locks fully corroborated the information provided by the informant and provided a nexus between the earlier drug transaction involving the defendant and the apartment to be searched. See Commonwealth v. Blake, supra at 829.
We conclude that, after striking the reference to the drugs and drug paraphernalia observed during the illegal search, the cumulative information remaining in the affidavit provided probable cause to believe that the cocaine and implements used for cocaine distribution would be found in the third-floor apartment at 7 Lynch Street. On the facts of this case, therefore, there was an independent source for the challenged evidence -- a valid search warrant untainted by information discovered during the initial entry into the apartment. [Note 11] Although the initial entry was
Page 628
illegal, it was irrelevant to the successful search that ensued, and, hence, the exclusion of the evidence is not warranted.

L. c. 266, s. 102A, a Superior Court judge correctly denied the defendant's motion to suppress evidence seized at the defendant's residence during the execution of a search warrant, where an affidavit, based on information from a confidential informant, presented facts and circumstances both demonstrating the basis of the informant's knowledge that the defendant was engaged in selling drugs and establishing the informant's reliability, and where independent police corroboration, in the form of additional information gathered during police surveillance and investigation of the defendant, provided a nexus between the defendant's drug activity and his residence. [300-305]
A Superior Court judge did not abuse his discretion in denying a criminal defendant's motion to dismiss his indictment for possession of an infernal machine on the ground that the Commonwealth's destruction before trial of a grenade simulator, which police found in the defendant's residence during the execution of a search warrant, deprived the defendant of potentially exculpatory evidence, where the judge's findings that the evidence was not destroyed in bad faith and that the defendant had not established that favorable evidence would have resulted from expert examination of the device were not clearly erroneous. [305-308]
INDICTMENTS found and returned in the Superior Court Department on January 16, 1998.
A pretrial motion to suppress evidence was heard by Richard J. Chin, J.; a motion to dismiss was heard by Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr., J.; and the cases were tried before John R. Tierney, J.
After review by the Appeals Court, the Supreme Judicial Court granted leave to obtain further appellate review.

Gail M. McKenna, Assistant District Attorney, for the Commonwealth.","COWIN, J. The defendant, Thomas J. O'Day, III, was found guilty of possession of an infernal machine in violation of G. L. c. 266, § 102A. [Note 1] He appealed from the denial of his motion to suppress evidence seized in his residence and his motion to dismiss the indictment charging possession of a grenade simulator that was destroyed by the Commonwealth prior to trial. The Appeals Court concluded that the motion to suppress should have been allowed and therefore reversed the judgment. Commonwealth v. O'Day, 56 Mass. App. Ct. 833 , 840 (2002). [Note 2] We granted the Commonwealth's application for further appellate review and affirm the conviction.
1. Motion to Suppress. On November 6, 1997, the State police executed a search warrant at the defendant's residence at 10 Hunt Street in Brockton, and they seized 1.64 grams of cocaine, a revolver, and a grenade simulator. The search warrant was issued based on the affidavit of John Brooks, a State trooper experienced in controlled substance investigations. The affidavit recites information supplied by a confidential informant and by State troopers who participated in surveillance of the defendant. The defendant concedes that the affidavit contained ""substantial information"" concerning the presence of drugs at DJ's Pub in Brockton where the defendant worked as a doorman, but claims there was no probable cause to believe that drugs were located at his home. [Note 3]
We note that the motion judge made findings of fact. However, our inquiry as to the sufficiency of the search warrant application always begins and ends with the ""four corners of the affidavit."" Commonwealth v. Villella, 39 Mass. App. Ct. 426 , 428 (1995). See Commonwealth v. Cefalo, 381 Mass. 319 , 328-330 (1980) (""Our reading of the affidavit . . .""); Commonwealth
Page 298
v. McRae, 31 Mass. App. Ct. 559 , 559-560 (1991) (citing G. L. c. 276, § 2B). The magistrate considers a question of law: whether the facts presented in the affidavit and the reasonable inferences therefrom constitute probable cause. That conclusion of law is neither buttressed nor diminished by other evidence. Thus, we determine whether, based on the affidavit in its entirety, the magistrate had a substantial basis to conclude that a crime had been committed, Commonwealth v. Donahue, 430 Mass. 710 , 715 (2000), and that the items described in the warrant were related to the criminal activity and probably in the place to be searched. Commonwealth v. Upton, 394 Mass. 363 , 370 (1985). The motion judge was correct that the affidavit established probable cause to search the defendant's residence, and we uphold on that basis. His findings of fact were superfluous. We summarize the facts recited in the affidavit.
a. Facts. From a confidential informant, State Trooper John Brooks learned of a cocaine-selling operation at DJ's Pub on South Main Street in Brockton. The informant had purchased powdered and ""crack"" cocaine from sellers at the pub during the previous year. According to the informant, the sales were made face- to-face in remote areas of the bar primarily during the evening, and the sellers kept the cocaine ""on their person."" The informant described one of the sellers as ""Tommy,"" a doorman at DJ's Pub who also supplied young males with cocaine for distribution. ""Tommy"" was known to Trooper Brooks as the defendant, who resided at 10 Hunt Street in Brockton. Brooks also was aware that the defendant had ""a lengthy record,"" which included thirty-two arraignments and on three occasions charges of unlawful possession of a firearm.
Based on this information, Brooks, with three other State troopers, conducted a series of surveillances. The first surveillance was of DJ's Pub on the evening of September 27, 1997. The defendant arrived in a truck registered to his girl friend and walked into the bar. Two men immediately approached him. Before the defendant's arrival, these two men had been pacing back and forth anxiously, looking out the front door, and were the only people in the bar who were not drinking. After a brief conversation, the defendant and these two men walked into the men's room together. A short time later, the defendant's
Page 299
companions left the bar after emerging from the bathroom with him. Trooper Marc Lavoie, another officer who appeared to have an extensive background in narcotics, stated that this behavior was consistent with drug distribution. [Note 4] The defendant repeated similar transactions with several other individuals in the bar that evening. The troopers also had the confidential informant make a controlled buy of cocaine from the defendant that evening at the bar.
A second surveillance took place on the evening of October 9, 1997. At approximately 7 P.M., Brooks and four other State troopers set up surveillance of the defendant's residence at 10 Hunt Street. Several vehicles were parked in front of the residence and in his driveway. Brooks observed ""other"" visitors arrive and depart from the defendant's residence after a ""brief stay."" Based on his experience, Brooks determined this behavior was consistent with narcotics distribution. The defendant was seen leaving his residence and departing in his truck at 8:13 P.M. Mobile surveillance followed the truck from the residence to DJ's Pub. At approximately 8:15 P.M., the defendant entered the bar, where interior surveillance had already been established. An anxious male immediately greeted the defendant, and the two sat at a table while exchanging something under it. At least four times on this evening, Brooks observed the defendant leave the bar and speak briefly on a cellular telephone as he looked up and down Main Street. At one time during the surveillance, the troopers observed the defendant leave the bar and enter the truck. An unknown male also left the bar and approached the truck. The man stood for two minutes at the open passenger side door of the truck, then closed the door and returned to the bar. Trooper Brooks believed that this activity was ""consistent with the manner in which narcotics [sales] are transacted."" The defendant then participated in a series of exchanges beneath a table in the bar with several individuals. The confidential
Page 300
informant made a controlled buy from the defendant in a similar manner, and the buy was observed by an undercover trooper.
A third surveillance of DJ's Pub and the defendant's residence occurred on November 1, 1997. State troopers observed the same pattern of visitors to the defendant's residence as on the previous occasion: ""several vehicles that arrived and departed . . . after a brief stay."" The defendant departed his residence at 8:04 P.M. and drove directly to DJ's Pub. Surveillance within the bar established that the defendant went into the men's room several times with a different male, each visit of short duration. The confidential informant engaged in a third controlled buy of cocaine from the defendant. Again, the defendant spoke on his cellular telephone in brief conversations outside the bar. At one point, he went to his truck, reached inside the passenger door, and immediately returned to the bar.
Brooks learned that electrical service for the defendant's residence was in his girl friend's name. Based on years of investigative experience, Brooks was aware that ""individuals who are involved in illegal activity frequently deploy others to register their vehicles and establish essential utilities [in order to] conceal [their] identity, place of residence, and to frustrate the efforts by law enforcement."" The trooper's description of the defendant's house stated that signs warning ""Beware of Dog"" and ""Prohibita el Paso"" were affixed to the doors of the residence.
The judge denied the motion to suppress, concluding, as do we, that based on the information in the affidavit, there was probable cause for the magistrate to believe that the defendant's residence was ""connected to the ongoing drug activity,"" and that the confidential informant's reliability had been established.
b. Probable cause. ""The Fourth Amendment [to the United States Constitution] and art. 14 [of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights] do not define 'probable cause' . . . ."" Commonwealth v. Cefalo, 381 Mass. 319 , 328 (1980). To establish probable cause to obtain a search warrant, the affidavit must ""contain enough information for the issuing magistrate to determine that the items sought are related to the criminal activity under investigation, and that they may reasonably be expected to be located in the place to be searched."" Id. ""Where
Page 301
information from a confidential informant is relied on to supply probable cause to arrest and to search, art. 14 requires that the affidavit apprise the magistrate of some facts and circumstances showing both (1) the basis of the informant's knowledge, and (2) the credibility of the informant or the reliability of his information."" Commonwealth v. Blake, 413 Mass. 823 , 826 (1992). [Note 5] Independent police corroboration of an informant's tip can compensate for deficiencies in either or both prongs to satisfy the probable cause requirement of art. 14. Id. at 826-827. ""Furthermore, the affidavit should be read as a whole, not parsed, severed, and subjected to hypercritical analysis."" Id. at 827. ""In each case, the basic question for the magistrate is whether he has a substantial basis for concluding that any of the articles described in the warrant are probably in the place to be searched."" Commonwealth v. Upton, 394 Mass. 363 , 370 (1985).
The information in the affidavit satisfied both prongs of the Aguilar-Spinellitest. See Commonwealth v. Upton, supra at 374, citing Spinelli v. United States, 393 U.S. 410 (1969); Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108 (1964). The confidential informant had a basis for knowing that the defendant sold drugs because he described in detail the individuals selling drugs in DJ's Pub, including the defendant, and the mechanics of a typical drug sale with ""Tommy,"" the defendant. The informant had personally purchased drugs from the defendant in the past year and participated in three controlled purchases of cocaine with the defendant, whom he confirmed was ""Tommy."" The level of detail the informant provided, both as to the identity of the seller and the drug-selling operation in DJ's Pub, was ""consistent with personal observation, not mere recitation of a casual rumor."" Commonwealth v. Alfonso A., 438 Mass. 372 , 374 (2003). See Commonwealth v. Parapar, 404 Mass. 319 , 322 (1989).
The affidavit also established the informant's veracity. The officers knew the identity of the informant and his ""whereabouts."" Commonwealth v. Alfonso A., supra at 375
Page 302
(distinguishing between ""untraceable, unknown"" sources and confidential, yet known informants). The informant provided a detailed description of the defendant's drug business that was confirmed by the controlled buys he made. See id. at 376; Commonwealth v. Parapar, supra at 323. See also Commonwealth v. Warren, 418 Mass. 86 , 89 (1994) (""A controlled purchase of narcotics, supervised by the police, provides probable cause to issue a search warrant"").
We are convinced, as was the motion judge, that the independent police corroboration supplied the additional ""color"" to establish probable cause to search the defendant's residence. Commonwealth v. Saleh, 396 Mass. 406 , 411 (1985). The defendant asserts that there was not a sufficient nexus between the activities at issue and the defendant's residence to establish that the defendant was storing or selling drugs there. Although the details provided by the confidential informant, standing alone, did not establish a nexus between the defendant's drug activity and his residence, the additional information gathered by the State troopers during their surveillances and investigation established probable cause.
""The nexus may be found in 'the type of crime, the nature of the missing items, the extent of the suspect's opportunity for concealment, and normal inferences as to where a criminal would be likely to hide' "" the drugs he sells. Commonwealth v. Cinelli, 389 Mass. 197 , 213, cert. denied, 484 U.S. 860 (1983), quoting United States v. Lucarz, 430 F.2d 1051, 1053 (9th Cir. 1970). The State troopers accumulated additional information that, based on their experience, was consistent with selling or storing drugs at the defendant's residence: brief visits by a number of people arriving in cars on two separate evenings several weeks apart [Note 6] and the listing of his truck and electrical utilities in his girl friend's name. See Commonwealth v. Parapar,
Page 303
supra at 321 (""The troopers opined, based upon the amount of traffic at the location, that there was a large scale drug operation there""). During two surveillances, the defendant was observed departing from his residence in his truck, proceeding directly to DJ's Pub, and engaging therein in what appeared to be drug transactions. The reasonable inference was that the defendant brought a substantial quantity of drugs with him to the pub. It was unlikely that the defendant obtained the drugs from within the bar, as the defendant argues, or from any other location because he was constantly watched by the officers. [Note 7] It appeared that the drugs were transported in the truck, to which he returned to replenish his supply. Given the value of drugs, the quantity the defendant sold each evening in the pub, and the frequency of visitors to his home, it was unlikely that the defendant would keep so large a supply of drugs in the truck while at home. Even though the defendant was not seen carrying anything from his house to the truck, cf. Commonwealth v. DiStefano, 22 Mass. App. Ct. 535 , 538 (1986) (drug dealer seen reentering house carrying small package), valuable quantities of crack and powdered cocaine are transported and sold in small bags that can be concealed easily on one's person. Indeed, the confidential informant stated that the sellers at the bar kept the cocaine ""on their person."" Finally, the defendant's residence had signs warning unwanted visitors from entering, which suggested
Page 304
further that the residence contained valuables. [Note 8] Based on this information, and the reasonable inferences the magistrate could draw, there was a sufficient nexus between the defendant's drug-selling activity and his residence to establish probable cause to search the residence. It was reasonable to expect the drugs to be present at that location.
The cases on which the defendant relies to argue that probable cause was deficient are not persuasive because they involve situations in which those types of inferences could not reasonably be drawn. Some, for example, lack any detail linking the defendant's residence to drug activity: Commonwealth v. Gauthier, 425 Mass. 37 , 40 (1997) (only information regarding defendant's home was that known drug dealer entered and departed residence); Commonwealth v. Chongarlides, 52 Mass. App. Ct. 366 , 370 (2001) (nothing to explain why drugs would be at place searched other than place was presumed to be residence of defendant, who three days before had used heroin at another location); Commonwealth v. Laughlin, 40 Mass. App. Ct. 926 , 927 (1996) (no evidence in affidavit other than defendant was drug dealer who lived at residence searched). Others are deficient in the type of corroborative evidence present in the instant case: Commonwealth v. Smith, 57 Mass. App. Ct. 907 , 908 (2003) (police observations of defendant driving one day from home to drug sale and, on another occasion, to home after drug sale without more); Commonwealth v. Olivares, 30 Mass. App. Ct. 596 (1991) (no specific information in affidavit tying defendant's residence to illegal drug transactions, other than that he lived at those premises). Here, the observations made on two occasions during surveillance of the defendant's home, plus surveillance tracking him proceeding directly from home to the bar where he immediately began dealing drugs,
Page 305
combined with observations of the defendant's going out to the truck as part of his sales activity, provided the requisite nexus between the residence and the drug dealing.
We conclude that the motion judge properly denied the motion to suppress the evidence seized during the execution of the search warrant.
2. Motion to dismiss. The defendant argues that the judge erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment for possession of an infernal machine. [Note 9] He claims that the destruction of the grenade simulator found in his residence during execution of the search warrant denied him potentially exculpatory evidence, because he could not have the device tested by experts to determine whether it met the statutory definition of ""infernal machine."" Thus he contends that the destruction of the device violated his right to a fair trial guaranteed by the due process clause of the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. The judge who heard this motion disagreed. We conclude that the judge did not abuse his discretion in so ruling.
""When potentially exculpatory evidence is lost or destroyed, the culpability of the government will be weighed along with the materiality of the evidence and the potential prejudice to the defendant."" Commonwealth v. Olszewski, 401 Mass. 749 , 754 (1988), S.C., 416 Mass. 707 (1993), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 835 (1994), quoting Commonwealth v. Charles, 397 Mass. 1 , 14 (1986). Even though the grenade simulator was the subject matter of the indictment and obviously material, [Note 10] the judge concluded that the defendant failed to meet his burden under the other two prongs of the balancing test. First, the judge found that there was no bad faith or culpability on the part of
Page 306
the police. Second, as to prejudice to the defendant, the judge ruled that the defendant had not established that favorable evidence would have resulted from an examination of the grenade simulator by the defense expert.
""When reviewing the denial of a motion to dismiss based on the Commonwealth's alleged [destruction] of exculpatory evidence, we accept the judge's subsidiary findings in the absence of clear error"" and ""will not disturb the judge's decision except for a clear abuse of discretion."" Commonwealth v. Cintron, 438 Mass. 779 , 784 (2003). The defendant claims that the judge's findings were clearly erroneous with respect both to culpability and prejudice. We examine each prong in turn.
In regard to the Commonwealth's culpability, the judge did not find ""an unacceptable degree of culpability on the part of the police."" On hearing expert testimony from both sides, the judge determined that the State police had a ""rational, good faith concern"" concerning the safety of the grenade simulator.
A grenade simulator is a device employed by the military to simulate the noise and effects of a real grenade. The Commonwealth's expert, Trooper William P. Qualls, [Note 11] testified that these devices typically contain more ""photo flash powder"" than devices that have caused physical injuries in the past. This particular device had been modified: metal pellets or BBs had been encrusted on its exterior to serve as shrapnel when the device exploded, rendering it even more dangerous. Qualls testified, and the judge concluded, that the device could not be stored safely because heat, shock, or friction might have caused it to explode. Furthermore, testing the device would have required that it ""be handled in an improper fashion . . . not taught [to the State bomb squad]"" and contrary to Federal guidelines. According to Qualls, when discovering an item that could potentially be a bomb, such as the device in this case, the
Page 307
police bomb squad employs a ""render safe procedure:"" they countercharge the device with an explosive material. That is what was done here. The police removed the device, and it was detonated four days later [Note 12] by members of the State police bomb squad who attached a blasting cap, placed it in a shallow hole and remotely triggered the explosion in a wooded area behind the State police barracks. An analysis of the dirt where the grenade simulator was detonated revealed that there was some flash powder inside the device.
Although the Commonwealth's destruction was intentional, the judge found that it was not done in bad faith. The police were confronted with the need to balance protection of the public and of themselves from injury against the preservation of evidence for use at trial. [Note 13] The judge credited the testimony of the Commonwealth's expert as opposed to that of the expert called by the defendant and could permissibly find that the Commonwealth was not culpable for detonating the device. Commonwealth v. Charles, 397 Mass. 1 , 14 (1986) (extraordinary circumstances mitigate culpability for lost evidence).
It was not error for the judge to conclude that the defendant had failed to satisfy his burden to demonstrate prejudice to him by the destruction of the device. The defendant has not shown a "" 'reasonable possibility, based on concrete evidence rather than fertile imagination,' that access to the [material] would have produced evidence favorable to his cause."" Commonwealth v. Willie, 400 Mass. 427 , 433 (1987), quoting Commonwealth v. Neal, 392 Mass. 1 , 12 (1984). The judge did ""not find from the
Page 308
evidence and argument of the defendant's expert and counsel a specific explanation of exculpatory information, tests, or processes available from a preserved device of this kind . . . whether a feasible test could measure the rate of powder burn; or whether a slow-motion video record of an alternate form of detonation would enable measurement of the force of the dispersing pellets or other components of the device."" The only evidence offered by the defense to demonstrate prejudice was the testimony of its expert that if there were suspicion that the device had been altered internally, he would have recommended an X-ray or CAT scan to determine whether it was actually modified. This does not constitute a ""reasonable possibility"" of producing evidence favorable to the defense. ""Where as here, the defendant relies on mere conjecture and surmise, contradicted by evidence in the record, that [the destroyed] evidence would have been exculpatory and where the evidence was [destroyed] not because of bad faith but under extraordinary circumstances which mitigate the culpability for the [destruction], there is no ground for reversal."" Commonwealth v. Charles, supra at 14.
Finally, the defendant argues that the ""judge did not apply the proper test"" for determining whether the destroyed evidence was exculpatory. The Appeals Court decision the defendant cites uses the same standard we recited above: ""When the evidence no longer exists and the defendant has made a specific request for it, the defendant need only show a reasonable possibility that the evidence was exculpatory. Put another way, the defendant is entitled to relief pursuant to the more favorable standard; whether access to the destroyed or lost evidence 'might have' affected the verdict"" (emphasis added). Commonwealth v. White, 47 Mass. App. Ct. 430 , 433 (1999). As the judge correctly found, the defendant has failed to show such a reasonable possibility.
3. Conclusion. Both the motion to suppress and the motion to dismiss were properly denied.

This court concluded that a criminal defendant's plea counsel did not render constitutionally ineffective assistance when he advised the defendant that there was no basis on which to appeal from the judge's denial of his suppression motion, given the state of the law at that time and the lack of any evidence that the defendant relied on that advice when he pleaded guilty.

INDICTMENTS found and returned in the Superior Court Department on June 11, 1991.
A motion for a new trial, filed on May 3, 2002, was considered by Charles T. Spurlock, J.
After review by the Appeals Court, the Supreme Judicial Court granted leave to obtain further appellate review.
Estera Halpern for the defendant.
Donna Jalbert Patalano, Assistant District Attorney, for the Commonwealth.","GREANEY, J. The defendant seeks to withdraw guilty pleas entered January 7, 1992, on indictments charging unlawful possession of a firearm, second offense, and unlawful possession of ammunition. The charges stemmed from an investigatory stop of the defendant initiated by officers of the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC) who had received a report of an armed robbery that had just been committed in the vicinity by ""two black guys."" While conducting a protective pat-down search of the defendant, the officers recovered a loaded . 32 caliber
Page 868
handgun. [Note 1] The defendant's motion to suppress the handgun and ammunition was denied by a judge in the Superior Court. The defendant subsequently entered guilty pleas on both indictments and was sentenced to a term of five years at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Concord (MCI, Concord) on the conviction of unlawful possession of a firearm. [Note 2]
In 1997, after serving the entire sentence, the defendant filed a pro se motion to withdraw his guilty pleas and be granted a new trial, pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (b), 378 Mass. 900 (1979). In his motion and supporting affidavit, the defendant asserted that his plea was involuntary because his plea counsel had pressured him into pleading guilty and had advised him that to do so would result in his serving ""less time."" The defendant's motion was denied by the same judge who had accepted his guilty pleas five years earlier. The defendant did not appeal from the order of denial.
In 2002, the defendant (now represented by counsel) filed a subsequent motion pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (b), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001), asserting that his pleas were involuntary because (1) they were based on incompetent advice from his plea counsel that to appeal from the denial of his suppression motion would be fruitless and (2) neither the judge nor plea counsel had advised him of the mandatory minimum sentence on the conviction of unlawful possession of a firearm, second offense. The defendant, his appellate counsel, and his plea counsel submitted affidavits in support of the new trial motion. The motion was denied without a hearing by a different judge (the judge who accepted the defendant's guilty pleas and denied his original pro se motion for a new trial had since been appointed to the Appeals Court). The denial was affirmed by the Appeals Court in an unpublished decision pursuant to its rule 1:28. Commonwealth v. Walker, 59 Mass. App. Ct. 1112 (2003). We granted the defendant's application for further appellate review and, after oral argument, remanded the case to the Superior Court for admission in evidence of a letter, referred
Page 869
to in supporting affidavits, sent to the defendant from his plea counsel and advising the defendant that there was no persuasive basis on which to appeal from the denial of his suppression motion. After receiving that letter in evidence, the judge again denied the defendant's motion without a hearing. We have considered the defendant's appeal from the order of denial in light of the letter from his plea counsel (now part of the record), affidavits submitted by the defendant, by his plea counsel, and by his appellate counsel, original and supplemental briefs submitted by the parties, and both oral arguments. We now affirm the order of denial.
We summarize the findings of fact made by the judge who denied the defendant's motion to suppress. At approximately 11:13 P.M. on June 4, 1991, a woman made a telephone call to the recorded dispatch line of the Boston police department to report a robbery that had just taken place at the corner of Mozart and Chestnut Streets in the Jamaica Plain section of Boston. The woman, who gave her name as ""Jean,"" stated that the robbery victim was a friend of her husband. She described the assailants as ""two black guys"" and indicated that one of them had a gun. The dispatch officer transmitted this information to police officers on duty in the vicinity. Within minutes, two MDC officers who had received the report observed a black male ""furiously pedaling"" a ""mountain bike"" approximately one block from where the robbery had occurred. The officers were suspicious and, pulling their marked police cruiser next to the man on the bicycle (the defendant), requested that he stop. The defendant did not respond but looked straight ahead and kept pedaling. The officers pulled their cruiser in front of the defendant, and one officer got out and stopped the defendant. The defendant stated, ""I didn't do it -- leave me alone."" The officer grabbed the defendant's arm and said that he just wanted to ask him a few questions. Fearful for his safety because the reported robbery involved a gun, the officer quickly patted down the defendant and discovered a loaded .32 caliber handgun on his person. Without being asked any questions, the defendant blurted out, ""some dude gave me that gun."" The officer gave the defendant his Miranda rights and then asked, ""What dude gave you the gun?"" The defendant responded that ""some dude""
Page 870
to whom he owed money gave him the gun. The defendant was arrested for possession of the handgun and ammunition.
Based on the facts set forth above, the judge concluded that the officers were justified in making a threshold inquiry of the defendant. The judge reasoned that the information known to the police officers ""via the police radio, the time of night, and the observed actions of the police collectively"" provided them with reasonable suspicion that justified their investigatory stop of the defendant. In addition, the judge ruled that the protective pat-down of the defendant at the outset of the stop was ""perfectly reasonable"" based on information that the robbery precipitating the stop was committed with a handgun. The judge identified two decisions in which this court had concluded there was no reasonable suspicion justifying a police stop. The judge first distinguished Commonwealth v. Antobenedetto, 366 Mass. 51 (1974), on the basis that the facts of that case involved a warrantless stop and search of an automobile based on information in a police broadcast that was unsupported by probable cause. See id. at 56 & n.2. The judge then discussed Commonwealth v. Thibeau, 384 Mass. 762 (1981), in which a defendant riding a bicycle made a sudden turn and pedaled down a side street after seeing a marked police cruiser. The judge reasoned that the police stop of the bicyclist in the Thibeau case was unlawful because the police had no basis whatsoever to conduct an investigatory stop of the bicyclist. The judge stated that the stop of the defendant ""was not based on mere suspicion, but reasonably reliable information provided to the police."" The judge further concluded that the defendant's initial statement to the officers was voluntarily made without interrogation and that his remaining statements were made after he was properly warned of his Miranda rights. Accordingly, the judge denied the defendant's motion to suppress the handgun, the ammunition, and his statements to police.
The following week, the defendant's plea counsel advised him in a letter that there was no basis on which to appeal from the judge's ruling. The defendant's plea counsel informed him that the judge had ""carefully crafted the facts so his legal finding is indisputable."" He stated that: ""No appellate court will change his findings of fact. And, based on his findings of fact,
Page 871
his legal conclusion is correct. . . . We have nothing to try in this case. They have you absolutely cold."" Two months later, the defendant pleaded guilty to the charges. No record of the pleas now exist.
A judge may grant a motion for a new trial only ""if it appears that justice may not have been done."" Commonwealth v. Fanelli, 412 Mass. 497 , 504 (1992), quoting Commonwealth v. DeMarco, 387 Mass. 481 , 482 (1982), and cases cited. When, as here, the motion includes a postsentence request to withdraw a guilty plea and the motion is filed after plea records have been destroyed, a new trial motion should be granted only ""if the defendant comes forward with a credible reason which outweighs the risk of prejudice to the Commonwealth."" Commonwealth v. Fanelli, supra, quoting Commonwealth v. DeMarco, supra at 486. The defendant argues that the judge's ruling was clearly erroneous and that his plea counsel's failure to appreciate the merits of a possible appeal constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. The Commonwealth asserts, correctly, that by failing to raise this issue in his first pro se rule 30 motion, the defendant has waived it. Waiver in this case also may be based on the defendant's failure to appeal from the denial of his first motion for a new trial. See Mains v. Commonwealth, 433 Mass. 30 , 34 (2000). That the defendant proceeded pro se does not affect his obligation to abide by procedural rules. See id. at 36. We therefore review any error to determine whether it may have created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See Commonwealth v. Russell, 439 Mass. 340 , 345 (2003).
A defendant whose plea counsel gives plainly incorrect advice, and who relies on that advice in tendering a guilty plea, has received ineffective assistance of counsel under the familiar standard set forth in Commonwealth v. Saferian, 366 Mass. 89 (1974), whether there has been ""serious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel -- behavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer [that] has likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence."" Id. at 96. In such a case, there could be no certainty that a defendant's decision to waive his right to a jury trial by entering pleas of guilty was made intelligently or voluntarily, with a
Page 872
full understanding of the consequences. See Kercheval v. United States, 274 U.S. 220, 223 (1927); Commonwealth v. Lopez, 426 Mass. 657 , 660 (1998). That constitutional infirmity would create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice and justify our granting the defendant's request to withdraw his pleas. See Commonwealth v. Nikas, 431 Mass. 453 , 459-460 (2000). See also Commonwealth v. Mahar, 442 Mass. 11 , 13-14 n.4 (2004). The determinative question is whether the defendant's plea counsel rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel when, in 1991, he advised the defendant that there was no basis on which to appeal from the judge's denial of his suppression motion. We conclude that he did not.
Based on principles originally stated in Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968), and fully developed thereafter in our case law, it is doubtful that evidence presented by the Commonwealth at the suppression hearing sufficiently proved that the stop of the defendant was lawful. Where a defendant files a pretrial motion to suppress evidence seized during a Terry-type stop, as occurred here, the Commonwealth bears the burden to prove that the police had reasonable suspicion, before initiating the stop, that ""a person has committed, is committing or about to commit a crime."" Commonwealth v. Comita, 441 Mass. 86 , 91 (2004), quoting Commonwealth v. Watson, 430 Mass. 725 , 729 (2000). Reasonable suspicion, in turn, must be ""based on specific, articulable facts and reasonable inferences therefrom."" Commonwealth v. Lyons, 409 Mass. 16 , 19 (1990), quoting Commonwealth v. Wren, 391 Mass. 705 , 707 (1984). Where police conduct an investigatory stop based on information gleaned from an anonymous tip, courts assess the sufficiency of the information in terms of the reliability of the informant and his or her basis of knowledge. See Commonwealth v. Lyons, supra at 20-22. Where the information relied on to establish reasonable suspicion is transmitted by radio bulletin, both the source of the information and the basis of the source's knowledge must be demonstrated to be reliable. See Commonwealth v. Cheek, 413 Mass. 492 , 494-497 (1992). Here, a woman who gave her name as ""Jean"" told a police dispatcher that a friend of her husband had just been robbed at gunpoint. She described the assailants by their race and nothing more.
Page 873
She did not indicate what type of clothing they wore, in what direction they had fled, or their mode of transportation. When the police first sighted the defendant, all they knew of him was that he was black and that he was ""furiously pedaling"" a bicycle one block from the reported robbery. The defendant's plea counsel argued at the hearing on the motion to suppress that there was nothing inherently suspicious about the defendant's behavior that would have warranted a reasonable inference that he was involved in criminal activity. In retrospect, we agree.
Given the state of law in the Commonwealth in 1991, however, the defendant's plea counsel's advice that, based on the judge's findings, an appeal would not be successful, was not patently wrong. The primary cases on which the defendant now relies to show legal error in the judge's ruling, Commonwealth v. Barros, 435 Mass. 171 , 172 (2001); Commonwealth v. Cheek, supra; and Commonwealth v. Berment, 39 Mass. App. Ct. 522 , 526 (1995), were decided after the challenged advice was tendered and, thus, could not have provided guidance to the defendant's plea counsel. In the five years preceding the defendant's guilty plea, the Appeals Court vacated only two orders denying motions to suppress based on Terry-type stops. See Commonwealth v. Carrasquillo, 30 Mass. App. Ct. 783 , 787 (1991) (order denying motion to suppress vacated); Commonwealth v. O'Laughlin, 25 Mass. App. Ct. 998 , 999 (1988) (same). Contrast Commonwealth v. Dise, 31 Mass. App. Ct. 701 , 703 (1991) (denial of motion to suppress affirmed); Commonwealth v. Patti, 31 Mass. App. Ct. 440 , 441-443 (1991) (same); Commonwealth v. Hurd, 29 Mass. App. Ct. 929 , 930 (1990) (same); Commonwealth v. Cardaleen, 26 Mass. App. Ct. 979 , 981 (1988) (same); Commonwealth v. Modica, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 334 , 338-339 (1987) (same); Commonwealth v. Reed, 23 Mass. App. Ct. 294 , 296 (1986) (same); Commonwealth v. Montgomery, 23 Mass. App. Ct. 909 , 910 (1986) (same). [Note 3] Further, neither Appeals Court decision reversing suppression
Page 874
motions presented facts similar to this case. In the first, Commonwealth v. O'Laughlin, supra, police officers stopped one of the last passengers off a shuttle flight from New York to Boston based on their observations that he walked rapidly and carried only a cloth jacket. See id. at 998. The second, Commonwealth v. Carrasquillo, supra, concerned an informant's uncorroborated tip that the defendant had gone to New York City and would return transporting cocaine and accompanied by a Hispanic man with a beard. The Appeals Court concluded that, without evidence indicating either the reliability or the basis of knowledge of the informant's information, the informant's tip alone could not give rise to a reasonable suspicion that the defendant had committed, or was committing, a crime. See id. at 786-787.
This court appears to have been even more deferential. In the five years before the challenged advice was given, we reversed only one order denying a motion to suppress evidence seized during a Terry-type stop. See Commonwealth v. Lyons, 409 Mass. 16 , 20-22 (1990). Contrast Commonwealth v. Fraser, 410 Mass. 541 , 543 (1991) (order denying motion to suppress affirmed); Commonwealth v. Moses, 408 Mass. 136 , 140 (1990) (same); Commonwealth v. Sanchez, 403 Mass. 640 , 645-646 (1988) (same); Commonwealth v. Andrews, 403 Mass. 441 , 460 (1988) (same); Commonwealth v. Tomeo, 400 Mass. 23 , 25 (1987) (same). See also Commonwealth v. Ferguson, 410 Mass. 611 , 615 (1991) (conviction reversed; evidence and statement should have been suppressed on other grounds than Terry stop); Commonwealth v. Helme, 399 Mass. 298 , 299-300 (1987) (order allowing motion to suppress affirmed). In Commonwealth v. Lyons, supra, a State trooper stopped the defendant's automobile based on an anonymous caller's tip that two white men, one named Wayne, had just purchased narcotics in Chelsea and would be heading for Maine in a silver Hyundai automobile with Maine registration 440-44T. Because the anonymous tip provided no information regarding the basis of the tipster's
Page 875
knowledge or his reliability, and because the defendants displayed no suspicious behavior whatsoever, this court concluded that the police did not have reasonable suspicion to stop the defendants. Id. at 20, 22.
Given, however, that both this court and the Appeals Court were consistently deferential toward judges' decisions with respect to the conduct of police officers in reviewing motions to suppress evidence seized in Terry-type stop situations, the advice given to the defendant by his plea counsel in 1991, that an appeal would be futile, was not totally misinformed or, at least, did not reflect the level of serious incompetence required to demonstrate constitutionally substandard legal assistance. We conclude that the advice fell within the range of reasonable competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases at that time. [Note 4] Subsequent legal developments cannot be used to alter present final decisions except in extreme circumstances not existing here; otherwise finality has no meaning.
Also of significance to our decision is the lack of any credible evidence that the defendant relied on the advice in the letter when he pleaded guilty. In fact, the defendant claimed in his pro se motion for a new trial that his plea decision was based on his attorney's advice that he would receive ""less time"" and did not even mention his attorney's advice regarding a potential appeal. Moreover, the letter containing the advice was dated October 26, 1991, and the guilty pleas were entered on January 7, 1992. Presumably, there were other communications between the defendant and his counsel regarding the merits of pleading guilty versus going to trial during that intervening time period, but the defendant offers no plausible evidence as to the content of these communications. Finally, there were other obvious benefits of the pleas. Sentencing documents in the record
Page 876
indicate that a portion of the defendant's term of imprisonment was served concurrently with another then being served, and that the sentence originally was to be served at MCI, Concord. Considering that the defendant served his sentence in full before filing his motion for postconviction relief, we conclude that the judge did not abuse his discretion in this matter. See Commonwealth v. Lopez, 426 Mass. 657 , 661-663 (1998) (judge not required to accept defendant's ""self-serving affidavit, alleging constitutional defects in conclusory terms"" as sufficient to satisfy burden under rule 30 [b]). The order denying the defendant's motion for a new trial is affirmed.

COMMONWEALTH vs. FREDERICK,"Constitutional Law, Assistance of counsel, Conduct of government agents. Due Process of Law, Assistance of counsel, Extrajudicial statement. Practice, Criminal, Assistance of counsel, Conduct of government agents.
This court concluded that where the government entered into an articulated agreement with an inmate to act as an informant, which agreement contained a specific benefit or promise thereof, the recipient inmate was a government agent for purposes of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution [456-465] and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights [465-468], even if the inmate was not directed to target a specific individual.
In a criminal trial, admission in evidence of the defendant's statements made to a jailhouse informant acting as a government agent violated the defendant's right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, where the informant deliberately elicited the statements from the defendant.

Donald A. Harwood, for Committee for Public Counsel Services, amicus curiae, submitted a brief.","IRELAND, J. In May, 1999, a jury convicted the defendant, Frederick Murphy, of murder in the first degree on the theory of deliberate premeditation; assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon (G. L. c. 265, § 15A [b]); unlawful possession of a firearm (G. L. c. 269, § 10 [a]); and unlawful possession
Page 453
of a firearm or ammunition without a firearms identification card (G. L. c. 269, § 10 [h]). The defendant appealed. He also filed a posttrial motion for discovery, which was granted in part by the trial judge, and an amended motion for a new trial, which the judge denied. As he did in his amended motion for a new trial, on appeal, he asserts, inter alia, that his right to counsel was violated by the admission of postindictment statements he made to a jailhouse informant who had signed a cooperation agreement with the United States Attorney's office. We conclude that, where the government has entered into an ""articulated agreement containing a specific benefit,"" or promise thereof, Commonwealth v. Reynolds, 429 Mass. 388 , 394 & n.7 (1999), the recipient inmate is a government agent for purposes of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights even if the inmate is not directed to target a specific individual. Because we conclude that the defendant's right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment and art. 12 was violated by the admission of the defendant's postindictment statements to a jailhouse informant who deliberately elicited the statement, and that the Commonwealth has not shown that the statement was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, the defendant is entitled to a new trial.
Background and procedure. We set forth the background facts from the trial transcript and the record, reserving details for our discussion.
At trial, the evidence against the defendant came from the testimony of an eyewitness and a jailhouse informant. The Commonwealth's theory of the motive for the murder was retribution: the defendant was angry that the victim was making payments (for drugs) to a Jamaican named Derrick Riley, nicknamed ""Randy."" It was purported that Riley was a member of a gang known as the 90's Posse.
Just after midnight on August 2, 1993, the victim was shot three times while walking from a friend's home toward his own home, both of which were located on Andrew Street in Springfield. Paul Smith, an illegal immigrant from Jamaica, was the only eye witness. Smith testified that it was about 11:45 P.M. on August 1 when he met the victim at the friend's house;
Page 454
earlier that evening, he and the victim had made plans to go to a night club.
Smith testified that he took a taxicab from his home to Andrew Street, but had the driver drop him off down the street from the friend's house. As he was walking up Andrew Street to meet the victim, he saw a ""kid"" in the driveway at 91 Andrew Street. He thought it was someone named Bernard and greeted him. Smith received no response and testified that he continued walking up Andrew Street to meet the victim.
At some point after Smith arrived at the friend's house, Smith and the victim started walking toward the victim's home. Smith was walking about three feet behind the victim but trying to catch up. A man wearing black pants and a black hooded sweatshirt emerged from the driveway at 91 Andrew Street holding a black revolver. Smith started running as the man chased the victim and fired shots. Smith looked back and saw the victim fall.
The victim's girl friend ran out of her home when she heard shots. As Smith was running past her, he told her that the victim was shot but did not identify the shooter, even though Smith testified at trial that he saw the defendant's face and that he and the girl friend both knew the defendant. At trial, the defendant's girl friend testified that when she saw the defendant in the early morning hours of August 2, he was wearing black pants and a black see-through shirt with gold speckles.
Smith kept running and did not return to the scene even though he saw the police arriving. Instead, he returned to his home, slept, and, later that day, went to New York City. He testified that he had relatives in Brooklyn and wanted to talk to them because he was frightened. Smith's relatives were not at home when he arrived and Smith testified that he discussed his situation with ""a person that I know"" from Jamaica. Smith told this person that it was the defendant who had killed the victim. He testified that the man told Smith that he needed to go back to Springfield and tell the police. Smith returned to Springfield, learned that the police were looking for him, and on August 3, gave police a statement identifying the defendant as the shooter.
Smith testified over two days. When the court recessed after the first day of Smith's testimony, the prosecutor had Smith in
Page 455
her office. She asked Smith to whom he had spoken in New York. The prosecutor learned for the first time that the individual was the alleged gang member, Derrick Riley. [Note 1]
The only other evidence of the defendant's involvement in the murder was the testimony of a jailhouse informant, who had a plea agreement with the United States Attorney's office, part of which could affect his sentence on Federal charges. After a voir dire of the informant, discussed infra, the judge rejected the defendant's argument that the informant should not be allowed to testify concerning statements the defendant had made to him. The informant testified that while being held in the Hampden County jail awaiting sentencing, he met the defendant. The defendant had been indicted and was represented by counsel at the time.
The informant testified that, after he had entered into the agreement with the United States Attorney's office, he did the defendant a favor. The defendant then started to converse with him more. [Note 2] From their conversations, [Note 3] the defendant learned that the informant's girl friend and Smith's girl friend were cousins. The defendant asked the informant to contact Smith through the girl friends and offer him fifty pounds of ""weed"" in exchange for not testifying. The informant did so and reported back to the defendant that Smith refused and was afraid.
The defendant then started talking to the informant about the victim, whom the defendant called his godson. The informant testified that the defendant stated that he and Riley had been in a gunfight in New York; that Riley ""was making all of the Jamaican guys work for him or pay him . . . money""; and that one of the people paying money to Riley was the victim. The
Page 456
informant stated that the defendant claimed to be angry with the victim, so the defendant ""licked"" him.
On two occasions during his testimony, the prosecutor elicited from the informant that he had an agreement with the Federal authorities but that he had no deal with the Commonwealth.
At trial, the defense claimed that the informant was lying so that he could be rewarded with a lighter sentence; that Smith was lying and either guilty himself or guilty of setting the victim up for Riley; that Smith was rewarded by the Commonwealth for his testimony when he was facing prosecution for unrelated crimes that occurred after the murder, but before the trial; and that there were other, related shootings in the nights leading up to this murder. The defense theory was that the victim had participated with others in breaking into the home of someone who worked for Riley and robbing the occupants and that all the shootings, including the victim's, were retaliation. As the victims of the robbery had never reported the crime and one of the alleged participants invoked his right not to testify pursuant to the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the judge restricted the admission of this evidence to Smith's state of mind. In addition, the defense alleged an inadequate police investigation. The defense pointed out that, although the investigation never closed, once police obtained the defendant's name from Smith, they did not fully follow up on other leads. [Note 4]
In his instructions to the jury, the judge told them that the evidence that the defendant tried to influence a witness could be used as evidence of consciousness of guilt.
Discussion. 1. Government agent under the Sixth Amendment. As noted, the defendant tried to have his statements to the informant suppressed. After a voir dire of the informant, the judge stated that although there was an agreement with the Federal government, there was no agency relationship with the
Page 457
Federal government and there was no evidence that the informant deliberately elicited information from the defendant. The defendant renewed his motion to suppress at trial, but it was denied.
He raised the issue again, with new evidence, in his amended motion for a new trial, which the judge denied. In his memorandum of decision, the judge relied on United States v. LaBare, 191 F.3d 60, 65, 66 (1st Cir. 1999), discussed infra, to conclude that there was no Sixth Amendment concern. He also stated that, in any event, there was no evidence that the informant deliberately elicited the statements from the defendant.
The defendant argues that the admission of the informant's testimony violated his right to counsel under either the Sixth Amendment or art. 12. [Note 5] We agree. [Note 6]
In October, 1998, the informant, a convicted felon, signed an agreement with the United States Attorney's office whereby he would plead guilty to thirty-five counts of a fifty-count indictment involving the informant's using a third party to purchase thirty-one firearms for him, which he then sold. The informant did not agree to a plea agreement until his codefendant had agreed to testify against him.
One of the terms of the agreement was that if the informant provided ""substantial assistance"" to the government, in the discretion of the United States Attorney's office, a motion could be filed so that the sentencing judge could ""impose a sentence below that which otherwise would be required under the Sentencing Guidelines."" At the hearing where the informant pleaded guilty, the assistant United States attorney stated, ""[The informant] has asked that he be able to cooperate in the course
Page 458
of other investigations. We don't know where that is going to go. He hasn't begun that cooperation yet."" [Note 7] In accepting the informant's guilty pleas, the judge stated, inter alia, ""Any cooperation brought forward by [the informant] will be considered if the United States attorney so moves."" The informant claimed during his voir dire that he was never asked directly by any law enforcement officer to engage in conversation with the defendant.
At some point after the defendant made his statement about ""licking"" the victim, the informant contacted his attorney and in March, 1999, the informant gave his statement to police. The informant's statement, which was in writing, said, in part, ""There haven't been any promises made to me for my testimony or this statement. I have been told that the U.S. Attorney's office would be made aware of my co-operation.""
In his written statement, the informant said that after the defendant told him that he was upset with the victim over his dealings with Riley, ""I asked [the defendant] what he did about that and he told me that he 'licked [the victim].' "" His written statement also stated that the informant was ""shocked that [the defendant] was telling me this shit but I wasn't totally surprised by it . . . [because the defendant] had a reputation on the streets as a shooter. He was always threatening people in jail that if this was the streets he would shoot them.""
Despite the informant's written statement to the contrary, during the voir dire concerning whether the informant would be allowed to testify at trial, the prosecutor told the judge that the informant had no deal with her and that she was ""not in a position to reward him."" In addition, as discussed supra, at trial she elicited statements from the informant that he had no deal with her. This information was incorrect. Documents obtained through posttrial discovery showed that the Commonwealth did, in fact, inform the United States Attorney's office of the informant's cooperation. [Note 8] The United States Attorney's office
Page 459
subsequently filed a motion to reduce the informant's sentence by fifty per cent.
In denying the defendant's amended motion for a new trial, the judge stated that even if the informant were an agent for the Federal government and such agency could be imputed to the Commonwealth, his conclusion was that the informant did not deliberately elicit the information from the defendant. Because neither the Commonwealth nor defense counsel raised the issue at the voir dire of the informant, the judge relied on the truth of the informant's written statement to the police that he specifically asked the defendant what he did about the victim to elicit the response that he ""licked"" him. The judge also relied on the informant's written statement that he was ""shocked"" at the response as evidence that the defendant's answer was not deliberately elicited.
The judge also concluded that, although the prosecutor did promise the informant that the United States Attorney's office would be made aware of his cooperation, the prosecutor's stating that she could not reward the defendant and eliciting equally false statements from the defendant did not require a new trial. The judge pointed to the fact that defense counsel knew from the informant's statement to police that there was a deal with the Commonwealth and that the jury heard the essential fact: there was a deal. Defense counsel, the judge concluded, focused much of his cross-examination on the informant's motive to testify.
""[W]e make an independent determination as to whether [an informant] was functioning as a government agent by applying constitutional principles to facts."" Commonwealth v. Harmon, 410 Mass. 425 , 429 (1991). The court accepts the findings of fact from a suppression hearing absent clear error. Id. at 428.
In this case, the defendant had been indicted in July, 1998. Thus, his Sixth Amendment right to counsel had attached at the time he made his statements to the informant. Commonwealth v. Torres, 442 Mass. 554 , 570 (2004), quoting Fellers v. United States, 540 U.S. 519, 523 (1977). Under the Sixth Amendment, if the government uses an agent deliberately to elicit statements from a defendant absent his counsel, those statements must be suppressed. Commonwealth v. Reynolds, 429 Mass. 388 , 393
Page 460
(1999), citing Massiah v. United States, 377 U.S. 201, 206 (1964), Maine v. Moulton, 474 U.S. 159, 172- 176 (1985), and Commonwealth v. Harmon, supra at 428.
The United States Supreme Court has not clearly defined the point at which agency arises. Agency was not a contested issue in Kuhlmann v. Wilson, 477 U.S. 436, 439 (1986) (police deliberately placed informant in cell with defendant); Maine v. Moulton, supra at 164-165 (codefendant wore wire transmitter); or Massiah v. United States, supra at 202-203 (codefendant allowed Federal customs agents to install transmitter in car and to listen to conversations with defendant). However, in United States v. Henry, 447 U.S. 264, 266, 270-271 (1980), the Court held that a jailhouse informant paid on a contingent fee basis was acting as an agent for the government. See United States v. LaBare, 191 F.3d 60, 65 (1st Cir. 1999) (circuits of United States Court of Appeals divided concerning agency because Massiah lacked precise formula and later cases ""waver in their emphases"").
In Commonwealth v. Reynolds, supra at 393-394, the Commonwealth promised ""to bring the witness's cooperation to the attention of prosecutors and the court, if and when requested."" The court held that where there is an ""articulated agreement containing a specific benefit,"" an agency relationship has been established. Id. at 394. Moreover, just the promise of recognition of cooperation is sufficient to establish an agency relationship. Id. at 394 n.7. The court supported its conclusion in part by reference to Commonwealth v. Harmon, supra, which cited United States v. Henry, supra.
A few months after the Reynolds case was released, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit issued its LaBare opinion, in which it stated that a cooperation agreement that does not target a particular defendant does not trigger ""a successful Massiah objection to information collected"" by a jailhouse informant. United States v. LaBare, supra at 65. There, in March, 1997, the informant entered into a general cooperation agreement with the Federal government promising to disclose ""all that he knows or has heard about violations of federal and state law."" Id. at 64. The informant was told not to question other inmates; he also was told he was not a government
Page 461
agent. Id. Also beginning in March, 1997, the defendant and the informant began talking, and the informant contacted an assistant United States attorney to report what he learned. Id. Once the informant met with an assistant United States attorney, on April 11, 1997, the government then focused the informant's attention on the defendant, but by then, all of the incriminating information had been revealed. Id. at 64-65.
The court acknowledged that there was a split among circuits of the United States Court of Appeals whether a defendant needs to be specifically targeted in order to trigger a Massiah concern. Id. at 65 & n.2, comparing Moore v. United States, 178 F.3d 994 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 943 (1999), and United States v. Birbal, 113 F.3d 342 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 976 (1997), with United States v. Brink, 39 F.3d 419 (3d Cir. 1994), and Creel v. Johnson, 162 F.3d 385 (5th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1148 (1999).
However, the court stated, ""Where the government asks a jail mate to report incriminating statements by anyone but has in no way focused . . . attention on an individual defendant, it is a stretch to describe the jail mate's inquiries of the defendant as 'government interrogation.' "" United States v. LaBare, supra at 65. The court stated that one reason it was rejecting the approach of the Third and Fifth Circuits, which use targeting of an individual defendant as ""merely"" one factor in making a determination whether Massiah was triggered, was because it was not a clear rule that law enforcement could follow. Id. at 65. Nevertheless, at the conclusion of its discussion concerning agreements that do not target individuals, the court stated, ""This may be a close call as to [the informant], given conflicting precedent."" Id. at 66. The court then relied on other witnesses and evidence to conclude that the admission of the informant's testimony was harmless. Id.
Although it is not apparent from the decision in the Reynolds case, the court's discussion of agency occurred in the context of a targeted individual and without the benefit of the analysis of the LaBare case. The judge had denied the defendant's motion to suppress his statements to the informant and his request for an evidentiary hearing. Commonwealth v. Reynolds, supra at 392. Because there were no findings of fact below, the court
Page 462
remanded the case for a determination of when the agency relationship was formed and whether the information to which the informant testified was obtained after he became an agent of the Commonwealth. Id. at 394-395.
The situation here, where the defendant was not individually targeted, presents us the opportunity to consider the issue in light of United States v. LaBare, supra. Although we are not bound by any decision of any Federal court other than the United States Supreme Court concerning Federal law, we give great deference to decisions of Federal courts if they seem persuasive. Commonwealth v. Hill, 377 Mass. 59 , 61 (1979). We conclude that there is nothing in Supreme Court precedent that mandates targeting as determinative of a person's status as a government agent. [Note 9]
In the LaBare case, the First Circuit stated that it was persuaded by the reasoning of the Second and Eighth Circuits that one is not an agent of the government unless a particular defendant is targeted. In United States v. Birbal, supra at 346, the Second Circuit stated, ""Other circuits agree that an informant becomes a government agent for purposes of Kuhlmann only when the informant has been instructed . . . about the particular defendant."" [Note 10] It is true that in the Kuhlmann case, the informant targeted the defendant, but as discussed supra, agency was not a contested issue in the case. Instead, the Kuhlmann case was concerned with addressing a question that was left open by the Court's decision in United States v. Henry, 447 U.S. 264 (1980), ""whether the Sixth Amendment forbids admission in evidence of an accused's statements to a jailhouse informant who was 'placed in close proximity but [made] no effort to stimulate conversation about the crime charged.' "" Kuhlmann v. Wilson, supra at 456, quoting United States v. Henry, supra at 271 n.9. The Court stated that ""a defendant does not
Page 463
make out a violation of that [Sixth Amendment] right simply by showing that an informant, either through prior arrangement or voluntarily, reported his incriminating statements to the police. Rather, the defendant must demonstrate that the police and their informant took some action, beyond merely listening, that was designed deliberately to elicit incriminating remarks."" (Emphasis added.) Kuhlmann v. Wilson, supra at 459. The Court then went on to discuss whether the informant deliberately elicited the defendant's incriminating statements. Id. at 460-461. Thus, although the Kuhlmann case supports the idea that in order for a violation of the Sixth Amendment to occur, a defendant's statement must be deliberately elicited, there is nothing in the decision that states that a defendant must be targeted for agency to attach. See United States v. York, 933 F.2d 1343, 1356 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 916 (1991), rev'd on other grounds, Wilson v. Williams, 182 F.3d 562 (7th Cir. 1999); Note, Government Responsibility for the Acts of Jailhouse Informants Under the Sixth Amendment, 101 Mich. L. Rev. 2525, 2535-2536 (2003) (discussing interpretations of Kuhlmann case); Tomkovicz, An Adversary System Defense of the Right to Counsel Against Informants: Truth, Fair Play, and the Massiah Doctrine, 22 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 1, 15-20 (1998) (positing that Massiah line of cases set up two-prong inquiry for Sixth Amendment violation: agency and deliberate elicitation).
Moreover, in the LaBare case, the First Circuit did not discuss what benefit the informant received for his promise to reveal everything he heard. In addition, despite its holding, the court called the case a ""close call . . . , given conflicting precedent,"" and proceeded to analyze other evidence against the defendant to determine that the inclusion of the informant's testimony was harmless. United States v. LaBare, 191 F.3d 60, 66 (1st Cir. 1999).
Given that nothing in any United States Supreme Court case requires targeting of a defendant for agency to attach, the First Circuit's concern that its case was a close call, and the split among the Federal circuits, we conclude that the holding in the Reynolds case, that ""an articulated agreement containing a
Page 464
specific benefit"" creates an agency relationship, is still valid. [Note 11] Commonwealth v. Reynolds, 429 Mass. 388 , 394 (1999). See Manns v. State, 122 S.W.3d 171, 178-188 (Tex. Ct. Crim. App. 2003) (reviewing various interpretations of United States Supreme Court precedent). Our conclusion is consistent with the United States Supreme Court's statement that the ""Sixth Amendment . . . imposes on the State an affirmative obligation to respect and preserve the accused's choice to seek . . . assistance [of counsel]. We have on several occasions been called upon to clarify the scope of the State's obligation in this regard, and have made clear that, at the very least, the prosecutor and police have an affirmative obligation not to act in a manner that circumvents and thereby dilutes the protection afforded by the right to counsel"" (emphasis added). Maine v. Moulton, 474 U.S. 159, 171 (1985).
Indeed, a bright line rule that requires targeting a specific defendant no matter what the agreement between the informant and the government would allow the government to circumvent its affirmative obligation to protect rights of the accused by creating what one court has called an ""informant at large."" United States v. Sampol, 636 F.2d 621, 638 (D.C. Cir. 1980). See Note, Government Responsibility for the Acts of Jailhouse Informants Under the Sixth Amendment, supra at 2532-2538. In the Sampol case, the informant was awaiting sentencing. United States v. Sampol, supra at 631. His freedom was contingent on his ""full cooperation with all the authorities, federal and state, anywhere in the United States."" Id. at 638. The court found that the principles articulated in United States v. Henry, 447 U.S. 254 (1980), applied and observed that the ""government trolled in the jail, using [the informant] as bait, and was ready to net any unwary inmate who rose to the lure."" United States v. Sampol, supra at 637-638. See Commonwealth v. Moose, 529 Pa. 218, 229 (1992) (""The fact that the Commonwealth intentionally left [the informant] there to harvest information from anyone charged with a crime and awaiting trial is the villainy"").
Page 465
In this case there was a specific agreement promising that the assistant United States attorney would file a motion to allow a judge to reduce the informant's sentence if he gave ""substantial assistance"" to the government. The assistant United States attorney stated at the hearing where the informant pleaded guilty that he did not know what form the informant's cooperation would take, and the judge stated that any cooperation would be taken into consideration if the United States Attorney's office so moved. The informant testified at his voir dire that he interpreted cooperation to mean ""find out information . . . and help get somebody convicted."" The informant was a government agent. Commonwealth v. Reynolds, supra at 394. Although the informant's agreement was with the United States Attorney's office, the Commonwealth may not use information obtained by unlawful police conduct. Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S. 431, 441-442 (1984), citing United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218 (1967) (discussing application of ""fruit of poisonous tree doctrine"" to Sixth Amendment right to counsel).
2. Government agent under art. 12. Even if our interpretation of the defendant's rights under the Massiah line of cases is overbroad, we nevertheless conclude that art. 12 protects the right to counsel in these circumstances.
In deciding whether art. 12 offers more protection of the right to counsel than the Sixth Amendment, ""our guiding consideration is whether the Federal rule adequately protects the rights of the citizens of Massachusetts."" Commonwealth v. Mavredakis, 430 Mass. 848 , 858 (2000) (art. 12 provides more protection than Fifth Amendment). This court looks ""to the text, history, and our prior interpretations of art. 12, as well as the jurisprudence existing in the Commonwealth."" Id.
Article 12 provides that ""every subject shall have a right to . . . be fully heard in his defence by himself, or his counsel, at his election."" ""We have long interpreted that text generously to recognize the 'fundamental . . . right of a person accused of a serious crime to have the aid and advice of counsel.' "" Commonwealth v. Rainwater, 425 Mass. 540 , 553 (1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1095 (1998), quoting Guerin v. Commonwealth, 339 Mass. 731 , 734 (1959). ""[T]he essential element of fairness in the administration of justice depends"" on the right to counsel. Guerin v. Commonwealth, supra at 734.
Page 466
We have elsewhere described in detail the instances where this court has interpreted the art. 12 right to counsel more expansively than the Sixth Amendment, including granting indigent defendants the right to appointment of counsel years before the United States Supreme Court recognized such rights and relieving the defendant of a burden to prove actual prejudice required by the Sixth Amendment where an attorney has an actual conflict of interest. Commonwealth v. Rainwater, supra at 553-554, and cases cited. More recently, in Lavallee v. Justices in the Hampden Superior Court, 442 Mass. 228 , 230-231 (2004), this court concluded that indigent defendants being held in lieu of bail were being deprived of their right to counsel under art. 12 where, because of the low rate of compensation being offered, the State was unable to enlist private attorneys for representation, and attorneys in the public defender division of the Committee for Public Counsel Services (CPCS) were unavailable. The court rejected the argument that the mere assignment of a defendant's case to CPCS for eventual appointment of an attorney was an adequate protection of the right to counsel. Id. at 234. The court stated that the right to counsel meant the right to effective assistance of counsel. Id. at 235, citing Kimmelman v. Morrison, 477 U.S. 365, 377 (1986). Accord Commonwealth v. Mavredakis, supra at 860 (""duty to inform a suspect of an attorney's efforts to render assistance is necessary to actualize"" or give substantive meaning to Miranda rights).
In that vein, this court has safeguarded the attorney-client relationship. In Commonwealth v. Manning, 373 Mass. 438 , 440, 443 (1977), the court found a Sixth Amendment violation where a drug enforcement agent contacted the defendant without his counsel's knowledge, disparaged the defendant's counsel, and urged the defendant to become an informant ""in a calculated attempt to coerce the defendant into abandoning his defense."" The court concluded that the action was so egregious that the indictment had to be dismissed. Id. at 444-445. In Moran v. Burbine, 475 U.S. 412, 422, 432 (1986), the United States Supreme Court held that under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, the police had no duty to inform a suspect of his attorney's efforts to render assistance where that suspect had not personally requested legal representation, but this court
Page 467
concluded that art. 12 imposed such a duty on police in order to give substantive meaning to a suspect's Miranda rights. Commonwealth v. Mavredakis, supra.
In two recent cases, this court has given substantive meaning to the prohibition, under the Sixth Amendment, against any ""knowing exploitation by the State of an opportunity to confront the accused without counsel being present,"" Maine v. Moulton, 474 U.S. 159, 176 (1985), by expanding the category of individuals considered government agents. In Commonwealth v. Hilton, 443 Mass. 597 , 614-615 & n.8 (2005), we held that questioning by a court officer violated the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel and rejected the Commonwealth's argument that the officer was not a government agent. We stated that the Massiah line of cases is concerned ""not merely with the actions of police themselves, but with 'secret interrogation by investigatory techniques that are the equivalent of direct police investigation.' "" Id. at 615, quoting Kuhlmann v. Wilson, 477 U.S. 436, 459 (1986). In Commonwealth v. Howard, 446 Mass. 563 , 563-564, 567, 569 (2006), we held that a social worker investigating for the Department of Social Services was a government agent when she questioned the defendant pursuant to her duties but then forwarded the defendant's responses to a district attorney's office.
In order to give meaning to the government's ""affirmative obligation not to act in a manner that circumvents and thereby dilutes the protection afforded by the right to counsel,"" Maine v. Moulton, supra at 171, art. 12 requires us to protect defendants from ""informants at large"" where, pursuant to Commonwealth v. Reynolds, 429 Mass. 388 , 394 & n.7 (1999), the informant has an articulated agreement with the government that contains a specific benefit or promise, and then trolls the jail for victims. ""Any other approach would lend tacit approval to affirmative police interference with the attorney-client relationship. We prefer to view the 'role of the lawyer . . . as an aid to the understanding and protection of constitutional rights,' rather than 'as a nettlesome obstacle to the pursuit of wrongdoers.' "" Commonwealth v. Mavredakis, supra at 860, quoting Moran v. Burbine, supra at 433 (Stevens, J., dissenting).
Nor are we concerned here with ""unnecessarily frustrat[ing]
Page 468
the public's interest in the investigation of criminal activity,"" Maine v. Moulton, supra at 180, that served as a reason the court in Commonwealth v. Rainwater, supra at 554, declined to find that art. 12 provided more protection for defendants who were questioned concerning uncharged offenses. [Note 12] Moreover, we have already referred to the decisions of other courts that have drawn conclusions similar to ours, albeit pursuant to the Sixth Amendment. See Creel v. Johnson, 162 F.3d 385 (5th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1148 (1999); United States v. Brink, 39 F.3d 419 (3d Cir. 1994); United States v. Sampol, 636 F.2d 621, 638 (D.C. Cir. 1980); Commonwealth v. Moose, 529 Pa. 218, 229 (1992). But see Commonwealth v. Franciscus, 551 Pa. 376, 394-395 (1998) (violation of both Sixth Amendment and State Constitution to use jailhouse informant's testimony concerning untargeted defendant's statements). Cf. Commonwealth v. Rainwater, supra at 555 (no other jurisdictions have adopted analysis suggested by defendant).
3. Deliberate eliciting of defendant's statements. Having found that the informant was a government agent for purposes of both the Sixth Amendment and art. 12, we now turn to whether the informant deliberately elicited statements from the defendant. Commonwealth v. Reynolds, supra at 393, citing Massiah v. United States, 377 U.S. 201, 206 (1964), and Commonwealth v. Harmon, 410 Mass. 425 , 428 (1991).
The judge concluded that even if the informant was a government agent, he did not deliberately elicit incriminating statements from the defendant. As discussed, the judge relied on the informant's written statement to police that he was ""shocked"" at the defendant's statement that he ""licked"" the victim. This was error.
In United States v. Henry, 447 U.S. 264, 274 n.12 (1980), the Court held that a paid informant was a government agent who
Page 469
lured the defendant into making incriminating statements. [Note 13] The Court stated that the informant accomplished this by ingratiating himself through his ""conduct and apparent status as a person sharing a common plight."" Id. at 274. The Court noted that the informant had so ingratiated himself to the defendant that the defendant solicited his aid to escape from jail. Id. at 274 n.12. The Court noted that ""the mere fact of custody imposes pressures on the accused; confinement may bring into play subtle influences that will make him particularly susceptible to the ploys of undercover Government agents."" Id. at 274. The government cannot deliberately create a situation designed to induce a defendant to make incriminating statements. Id.
In this case, incriminating statements were deliberately elicited. Taken alone, the informant's questioning the defendant about what he did about his anger toward the victim was a deliberate elicitation of the incriminating statement that the defendant ""licked"" him. The judge relied on the credibility of only a part of the informant's (uncontested) written statement that he was ""shocked"" to conclude that there was no deliberate elicitation. The judge ignored that part of the statement that put this alleged shock in perspective. He was ""shocked,"" but ""wasn't totally surprised"" because the defendant had a reputation as a shooter and was always threatening people in the jail, saying he would shoot them if ""this was the streets."" See Commonwealth v. Hilton, 443 Mass. 597 , 604, 613 (2005) (court officer's questions about fire after defendant's spontaneous remarks including statement, ""I could have killed my grandchildren,"" was deliberate elicitation of incriminating statement because officer should have known questions would elicit incriminating response).
However, the informant did more than just ask a direct
Page 470
question. The defendant did not even speak to the informant until the informant hid a ""shank"" for him. See note 2, supra. Once they began talking, the defendant asked the informant to contact the only eyewitness in the case and ask him not to testify in exchange for ""weed."" The informant did not pretend to contact the witness and go to authorities. Instead, he actually did contact the witness. It was only after these two incidents that the defendant began discussing the victim and the informant was able to ask the defendant what he did about his anger toward the victim. This was not a case of merely passive listening where, by luck or happenstance, the informant acquired incriminating information about the defendant. Maine v. Moulton, 474 U.S. 159, 176 (1985), citing United States v. Henry, supra at 276 (Powell, J., concurring). Through his conduct, he created an environment that lured the defendant into a false sense of trust of the kind considered in United States v. Henry, supra. Massiah v. United States, 377 U.S. 201 (1964), ""not only prohibits direct interrogation of a defendant, but more generally prohibits any 'knowing exploitation by the State of an opportunity to confront the accused without counsel being present.' "" Commonwealth v. Howard, 446 Mass. 563 , 568 (2006), quoting Maine v. Moulton, supra. See Commonwealth v. Hilton, supra at 614. As the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit observed in United States v. York, 933 F.2d 1343 (7th Cir. 1991), an informal agreement promising a reward for suitable information makes an informant an agent and the ""structure of the deal maximize[s] [the informant's] incentive to cooperate since the strength of the government's support would be a direct function of the assistance he provide [s]."" Id. at 1358, 1356-1360 (recognizing trolling to be improper; finding that while informant was agent, he did not deliberately elicit statements from defendant).
Once he had the defendant's statement that he ""licked"" the victim, the informant contacted his attorney within a short period of time. See United States v. York, supra at 1360 (stating that informant's waiting several months to report what he heard from defendant was evidence that he was telling truth when he said he did not deliberately elicit information). The statements should have been suppressed.
Page 471
Constitutional errors are presumptively prejudicial and it is incumbent on the Commonwealth to make an affirmative showing that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Commonwealth v. Rios, 412 Mass. 208 , 214 & n.8 (1992), and cases cited. The Commonwealth's brief makes no argument concerning whether the error was harmless, and thus it has not made the requisite showing. We note that the only other evidence against the defendant was the testimony of Paul Smith, the only eyewitness, who had contact with Riley before telling the police that the defendant was the shooter. The prejudice was exacerbated by the judge's instruction to the jury that they could consider the defendant's attempt to influence Smith's testimony, which the defendant accomplished using the informant, as evidence of consciousness of guilt. We conclude that a new trial is warranted. [Note 14]
Conclusion. For the reasons set forth above, we conclude that under the Sixth Amendment and art. 12, a jailhouse informant who has an agreement containing a specific benefit or promise thereof does not have to target an individual defendant specifically to be an agent of the government. In addition, we conclude
Page 472
that the jailhouse informant deliberately elicited incriminating statements from the defendant in violation of his right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment and that these statements were not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The judgments are reversed, the verdicts set aside, and the cases are remanded to the Superior Court for a new trial.

At the trial of indictments charging the defendant with drug and firearm offenses, the erroneous admission of certificates of drug and ballistics analysis 

without live testimony by the technicians who performed the tests was not 

harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, where there was little, if any, evidence 

to prove the nature of the substances or the operability of the firearms; 

however, the admission of a certificate of ballistics analysis with respect to 

the charge of possession of ammunition without a firearm identification 

card was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, where the cartridges 

themselves and the testimony of a police officer that they were found in 

the gun at the time it was seized provided overwhelming evidence that the 

cartridges met the statutory definition of ammunition. [263-265]
A Superior Court judge did not err in denying the criminal defendant's pretrial 

motion to suppress evidence seized from his residence pursuant to a search 

warrant, where the facts set forth in the affidavit accompanying the application for the warrant provided a sufficient nexus between the defendant's 

residence and his drug-selling activities to establish probable cause to 

search the residence. [265-268] GRAINGER, J., concurring. BERRY, J., 

dissenting.
At a criminal trial, no error arose from the admission of evidence seized from 

the basement of the defendant's residence, where the defendant did not 

have an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the basement, to 

which the landlord also had full access, and where the evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant 

had constructive possession of the items in the basement. [268]

The defendant raises two primary issues in this appeal from his convictions of various drug and firearm offenses.
First, he argues that admission of certificates of drug and ballistics analysis, absent live testimony, violated his right to confrontation pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Second, the defendant contends that evidence seized from his residence should have been suppressed for lack of probable cause. We reverse all but the ammunition conviction given the error in admitting the certificates. But because we conclude that there was probable cause to search the defendant's residence, we remand for new trial on those charges.
1. Sixth Amendment. Ballistics and drug certificates were admitted at trial over the defendant's objection. There is no doubt that their admission, absent live testimony or the opportunity to cross-examine, violated the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment. Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 129 S. Ct. 2527 (2009). We review, therefore, to determine whether the admission of the certificates was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. ""Our review presumes that the constitutional violation requires reversal, but an affirmative showing of harmlessness beyond a reasonable doubt by the Commonwealth will preserve the convictions."" Commonwealth v. Fluellen,
, 526 (2010). ""In considering the essential question whether the error had, or might have had, an effect on the jury and whether the error contributed to or might have contributed to the verdicts, our focus is not on whether the jury could have convicted the defendant had the tainted evidence been excluded; it is not
Page 264
enough for the Commonwealth to demonstrate that its other, properly admitted evidence was sufficient to convict the defendant or that the inadmissible evidence was consistent with the admissible evidence. Rather, we ask whether, on the totality of the record before us, weighing the properly admitted and the improperly admitted evidence together, we are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the tainted evidence did not have an effect on the jury and did not contribute to the jury's verdicts."" Commonwealth v. Tyree,
, 701 (2010) (quotations and citations omitted). See Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 23-24 (1967).
The Commonwealth primarily argues that the erroneous admission of the certificates was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because neither the composition of the narcotics nor the operability of the firearms were ""live"" issues at trial. This, however, is not enough where, as here, there was little (if any) evidence to prove the nature of the substances or the operability of the firearms. See Commonwealth v. Vasquez,
, 368 (2010); Commonwealth v. Charles,
, 383 (2010). Even if a defendant does not contest the composition of the alleged drugs, or the operability of a firearm, the ""defendant's theory of his case cannot relieve the Commonwealth of its burden of proving every element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt."" Commonwealth v. Shea,
, 269 (1986). Nor does the fact that defense counsel at various points referred to the objects as a ""gun,"" or heroin, or cocaine satisfy the Commonwealth's burden of proving the guns' operability or the substances' composition.
Commonwealth v. Charles, 456 Mass. at 383.
That said, we conclude based on Commonwealth v. Muniz,
Page 265

, 172-173 (2010), that the admission of the certificate of ballistics analysis with respect to the ammunition charge was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The crime of unlawful possession of ammunition requires the Commonwealth to show that the bullets found in the defendant's firearm were ""designed for use in any firearm."" G. L. c. 140, § 121. Here, as in Muniz, 456 Mass. at 171, the Commonwealth introduced in evidence the gun and the rounds found inside the gun when it was seized. A police officer testified at trial that the rounds were found inside the gun. ""The cartridges themselves and the officer's testimony that they were found . . . in the gun at the time it was seized[] provide overwhelming evidence that the cartridges met the statutory definition of ammunition."" Id. at 173.
2. Motion to suppress. The defendant argues that the affidavit supporting the application for a search warrant did not set forth a ""nexus"" with his residence sufficient to establish probable cause. To determine whether a sufficient nexus has been made out, we read the affidavit as a whole, without isolating or deconstructing its individual parts, or subjecting it to strained or hypercritical analysis. See Commonwealth v. Blake,
, 827 (1992). ""The nexus may be found in 'the type of crime, the nature of the missing items, the extent of the suspect's opportunity for concealment, and normal inferences as to where a criminal would be likely to hide' the drugs he sells."" Commonwealth v. O'Day,
, 302 (2003), quoting from Commonwealth v. Cinelli,
, 213, cert. denied, 484 U.S. 860 (1983).
""When that location is a residence, there must be specific information in the affidavit, and reasonable inferences a magistrate may draw, to provide 'a sufficient nexus between the defendant's drug-selling activity and his residence to establish probable cause to search the residence.' "" Commonwealth v. Pina,
, 440-441 (2009), quoting from Commonwealth v. O'Day, 440 Mass. at 304 (single observation of drug dealer leaving his residence to go to drug transaction did not provide sufficient nexus). ""Information establishing that a person is guilty of a crime does not necessarily constitute probable cause to search the person's residence."" Commonwealth v.
Page 266
Cinelli, 389 Mass. at 213. ""It follows that probable cause to expect that drugs will be present in a home is not established by the fact that the defendant lives there."" Commonwealth v. Pina, 453 Mass. at 441. Just as residency alone does not establish probable cause, ""the fact that a defendant drives from his home to the location of a drug transaction, and returns to his home on the transaction's conclusion, with
connecting the residence to drug sales, does not provide probable cause to search the residence"" (emphasis added). Commonwealth v. Medina,
, 1011 (2009), quoting from Commonwealth v. Pina, 453 Mass. at 441 (single round trip to and from drug transaction did not establish probable cause to search residence). Among the infinite variety of additional facts human behavior can provide (together with the reasonable inferences to be drawn from them) to establish probable cause to search a residence, one cannot exclude a drug dealer's pattern of leaving and returning to his residence for each drug sale. A pattern of repeated activity giving rise to a reasonable inference that a dealer's residence is being used as the base for his drug operation provides sufficient nexus to search his residence.
Summarized, the facts in the affidavit in this case were as follows. A confidential informant (CI) told police that he (a pronoun used for convenience, not to signify gender) knew of a heroin dealer in Brockton who used two different automobiles (one a white Toyota, the other a green Audi with fancy wheels) to deliver drugs to prearranged locations. Using this information, the police worked with the CI to make four controlled purchases of heroin over the next two weeks. On each of these occasions, the CI called the defendant by telephone and asked for a specific quantity of drugs. The defendant then specified the location at which to meet. The defendant arrived by car (either the white Toyota or the green Audi) and picked up the CI. He drove a short distance with the CI in the car, during which a sale of heroin took place. The CI was then let out of the car. After each of these sales, the defendant drove directly to his residence, and parked the car in the parking lot. He then entered the house through its rear entrance, located near the basement. In addition, on one of these occasions, police observed the defendant drive the Toyota away from his residence a few
Page 267
minutes after arranging a sale by telephone with the CI. The defendant then drove directly to the prearranged location where he sold drugs to the CI.
On two additional occasions during the same two-week period, the defendant was observed to leave his residence, get directly into the Audi, and drive to a location where he picked up a woman, drove a short distance, and then dropped her off. He returned directly to his residence. This behavior was in all material respects identical to the defendant's modus operandi in the controlled purchases and it takes no leap of imagination to infer that these too were drug transactions.
See Commonwealth v. Santiago,
, 576 (2008), quoting from Commonwealth v. Jimenez,
, 218 (2002) (""affidavits in support of search warrants are to be approached with a view toward common sense, read in their entirety and with considerable latitude allowed for the drawing of inferences""). On the first of these two occasions, the defendant took counter measures while driving to ensure he was not followed. Also on this occasion, after parking the Audi when he returned home, he opened the driver's door of the Toyota and then its hood. After looking around to ensure he was not being watched, he either took something from the engine compartment or placed something in it. He then went inside his residence, using the rear door.
In summary, the defendant was seen leaving and returning to his residence multiple times to what were either known drug sales or to encounters that could readily be inferred to be drug transactions. A pattern of activity such as this, in our view, provides sufficient nexus to a dealer's residence to satisfy probable cause to search it. In addition, the defendant's use of multiple cars makes it more likely that he stored drugs in his residence, rather than in the vehicles. Moreover, whatever the defendant was storing in the engine compartment of the Toyota, he had no need to access it on the way to a sale. Rather, that material was either deposited into the compartment after a sale or taken from the compartment into his house. Either way, it bolsters the inference that drugs were stored in the house, rather than in the vehicles. Furthermore, the defendant always used the rear
Page 268
entrance to the house, and the landlord confirmed that the occupants of the defendant's apartment were the only people (in addition to the owner) who had access to the locked basement and a locked storage container that were located at the rear of the house.
The defendant's motion to suppress was properly denied.
3. Other issues. We address briefly the other issues raised by the defendant. The judge correctly determined that the defendant did not have an objectively reasonable expectation of privacy in the basement to which the landlord also had full access. See Commonwealth v. Williams,
, 208-209 (2009) (and cases cited therein). Finally, there was no error in denying the defendant's motion for a required finding of not guilty regarding the charges based on items discovered in the basement. The evidence, taken in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, was sufficient to allow a jury to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant had constructive possession over the items in the basement.
For the reasons set forth above, the defendant's conviction of possession of ammunition (indictment no. 06-00182-003) is affirmed. The judgments on the other indictments are reversed, the verdicts are set aside, and the cases are remanded to the Superior Court for a new trial.
So ordered.

. I write separately because our case law on the issue of nexus and probable cause no longer appears to provide useful precedent. This case illustrates that certain assumptions underlying our rescript decision in Commonwealth v. Smith,
(2003), and thereafter adopted by the Supreme Judicial Court in Commonwealth v. Pina,
(2009), and Commonwealth v. Medina,
(2009), would benefit from reexamination.

A known drug dealer is observed leaving his residence,
Page 269
proceeding directly to a controlled buy, and then returning directly home. This does not establish to a certainty that the drugs which were sold under surveillance were retrieved from a supply kept at the residence -- but it provides a rational observer with a reasonable basis to consider it probable.
The term ""probable cause"" is not defined in either the Federal Constitution or our Declaration of Rights. Commonwealth v. O'Day,
, 300 (2003). ""Probable"" refers to an inference ""that can reasonably be expected or believed on the basis of the available evidence, though not proved or certain."" Webster's New Universal Unabridged Dictionary 1433 (2d ed. 1983). ""[F]or there to be probable cause, the facts must be such as would warrant a belief by a reasonable man."" Black's Law Dictionary 1321 (9th ed. 2009), quoting from LaFave and Israel, Criminal Procedure § 3.3 at 140 (2d ed. 1992).
Our task therefore has been, and remains, to apply ""probable"" in a continuum somewhere between possible and certain. The variation in background and circumstances presented by each successive case has resulted in appellate pronouncements relying on ever finer factual distinctions employed to support a particular result for that case; police, prosecutors, defense counsel, magistrates and judges are consequently deprived of useful guidance.
Probability does not require the elimination of competing explanations; that would be certainty. In many cases, including this one, the competing explanations to be derived from observed facts are that the defendant kept drugs in a car or on his person, rather than in his home. The existence of these alternatives would not remove a basis to search the defendant's home in my opinion, even if they claimed parity with the probability of drug storage in the home. But they do not: cars and other vehicles
Page 270
are less private and less secure than buildings, while keeping drugs on one's person removes the ability to disclaim ownership. However, having denied for legal purposes what a reasonable person
would consider self-evident, we have been required to embark on a search for additional indicia of residential drug storage that are generally less convincing than the round-trip controlled purchase properly surveilled from portal to portal. Not surprisingly, consensus has eluded us.
As in this case, reasonable judges can and do differ on the significance of using the same entrance to a building, engaging in activity which looks like a drug transaction but might be something else, registering utilities in one's own name or someone else's, raising the hood of a car on one occasion but not on another, and so forth. Having denied the inference properly drawn from the stronger evidence, we seek to remedy the shortfall with a collection of the weaker. At some point, of course, a large accumulation of facts with weak import may be said to provide a critical mass, but this approach is unsatisfactory in my view and in any event does not often present itself for appellate review.
In sum, I believe the majority and dissent reach equally defensible results, depending largely on how one chooses to interpret the mandate for additional ""particularized information"" required by Pina, supra at 442. Under these circumstances, because I consider probable cause to have been demonstrated, I join in the result reached by the majority.

. Respectfully, I dissent because I believe that on the current state of the law, the cases of Commonwealth v. Pina,
(2009), and Commonwealth v. Medina,
(2009), control this case. See Part 1, infra.
I also dissent because I do not believe that, within the four corners of the search warrant affidavit, a probable cause nexus
Page 271
to the apartment building in which the defendant lived was established. See Part II, infra. While the affidavit suggests suspicion that heroin may have been stored in the defendant's apartment building, a hunch is not enough under the particularized probable cause requirements of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights. ""In each case, the basic question for the magistrate is whether he has a
for concluding that any of the articles described in the warrant are probably in the place to be searched"" (emphasis added). Commonwealth v. Upton,
, 370 (1985). Here, reduced to essentials, the search warrant affidavit describes four small heroin controlled buys by an informant -- three ""ones"" for forty or sixty dollars, and a ""two"" for $100. All the buys occurred by way of automobile deliveries by the defendant, away from the apartment building.
Nothing is set forth in the affidavit that directly ties these four drug sales to the apartment building. Indeed (as further detailed herein), from all that appears in the affidavit, it was two automobiles, an Audi and a Toyota, that presented as most probably ""the place to be searched"" for any stored heroin. Id. at 370. Beyond these inadequacies, the omissions in the affidavit here are telling when compared to the search warrant affidavit that was found to establish probable cause nexus to a residence in Commonwealth v. O'Day,
(2003). See Part 2, infra.
Turning to the first basis of this dissent, I believe this court is bound to apply the controlling precedent of Pina, supra, and Medina, supra.
The Supreme Judicial Court ""is the highest appellate authority in the Commonwealth, and [its] decisions on
Page 272
all questions of law are conclusive on all Massachusetts trial courts and the Appeals Court."" Commonwealth v. Vasquez,
, 356 (2010).
Here, as in Pina and Medina, there was only one transaction in which the investigators had set up surveillance at the defendant's apartment building and saw the defendant drive from the parking lot to the site prearranged with the informant, sell the ""two"" to the informant for $100, and then drive back to the apartment building. In the other three transactions, there was no such point of origin surveillance. Thus, in three of the four deals, it was unknown where the defendant originally came from in order to reach the prearranged site, and the affidavit does not state, nor could it state, that the defendant's point of origin before driving to the prearranged site was the apartment building.

In Pina, 453 Mass. at 442, the Supreme Judicial Court held that ""a single observation of the defendant driving from the apartment to a location where he sold an unspecified quantity of cocaine to the informant"" did not constitute
""specific allegations, or particularized information based on police surveillance or otherwise, that would permit a reasonable inference that the defendant likely kept a supply of drugs in his apartment.""
Furthermore, in Pina -- so too, in this case -- there are no other connective factors that link to the apartment building. That is, like the Pina affidavit, this affidavit did not include ""details about the amount and quantity of drugs the defendant
Page 273
had sold in the past, or any other facts tending to demonstrate that the defendant sold drugs from his apartment or that he kept a supply of drugs there."" Ibid. Given the foregoing, and following the Pina analysis, the affidavit here -- with only one surveilled round trip from the defendant's apartment building parking lot to the prearranged site -- does not demonstrate, by particularized probable cause, a nexus to the apartment building as a place with ""a substantial basis"" to be the location of a supply of heroin.
The court's analysis in the Medina case confirms the Pina rejection of one round trip as a predicate for probable cause nexus to a residence. In Medina, 453 Mass. at 1011, the court wrote as follows:
""[In the Pina case], we reiterated the principle that evidence establishing that a person may be guilty of illicit drug activity does not necessarily establish probable cause to search that person's residence for drugs. . . . The affidavit before us contains the following information linking the defendant's drug activity to his apartment: (1) he drove from the apartment to a prearranged location where he sold cocaine to a police informant; and (2) after the sale, he drove back to his apartment. The obvious flaw, as was the case in the Pina and [Commonwealth v. Smith,
(2003),] decisions, is that the affidavit lacks the requisite nexus between the items to be searched for (drugs and drug paraphernalia) and the place to be searched (the defendant's apartment) to constitute probable cause to search.""
In sum, in this case, when one applies the analysis that one round-trip surveillance of a drug sale is insufficient, see Pina, supra, and Medina, supra, as this court is bound to do, there are only blanks, not connective dots, in the affidavit, leaving no probable cause nexus between the apartment building and the defendant's four small sales of heroin in offsite car transactions. Accordingly, I dissent from the majority holding in light of the Pina-Medina precedent.
2.  Second, I dissent because, even apart from the Pina-Medina precedent, I am not persuaded that, within the four corners of
Page 274
the affidavit, the constitutional standard of particularized probable cause was met. ""[T]he sufficiency of the search warrant application always begins and ends with the 'four corners of the affidavit.' "" Commonwealth v. O'Day, 440 Mass. at 297, quoting from Commonwealth v. Villella,
, 428 (1995). ""The right of police officers to enter into a home, for whatever purpose, represents a serious governmental intrusion into one's privacy. It was just this sort of intrusion that the Fourth Amendment was designed to circumscribe by the general requirement of a judicial determination of probable cause."" Commonwealth v. Forde,
, 805 (1975). Accordingly, where the place to be searched is a residence, the affidavit must include specific information and reasonable inferences a magistrate may draw to provide ""a sufficient nexus between the defendant's drug-selling activity and his residence to establish probable cause to search the residence."" Commonwealth v. O'Day, 440 Mass. at 304. That nexus is not established here.
To the contrary, if one looks within the four corners of this affidavit, there is only a broken line that cannot connect probable cause to the apartment building. (Compare the O'Day case, discussed infra.) In this case, there is no indication that the informant ever saw drugs in the defendant's apartment building. There is no surveillance indicating that drugs were sold by the defendant from within the apartment building. There is no indication that the defendant was within the apartment when the sales were set up by the informant's telephone calls. There is no indication that the defendant ever carried anything from the apartment building. And as previously noted, there is nothing in the affidavit about the defendant leaving the apartment building prior to three of the four controlled buys. Indeed, the only round-trip surveillance refers to the defendant driving from the parking lot
-- it appears that the police did not see the defendant leave the building, and did not see his actions with respect
Page 275
to the Audi and Toyota cars before he left the parking lot -- a point of import, to which I now turn.
From all that appears in the affidavit, it was more probable that the heroin was stored in the interchangeable Audi and Toyota cars, which the defendant drove to the prearranged heroin dealing sites. On that point, I note that in two separate surveillances (not part of the four controlled sales to the informant), the police observed the defendant engaging in unusual activity that indicated he was placing something into or moving something around between the Audi and the Toyota. During one such surveillance conducted on April 1, 2005, detectives observed the defendant, accompanied by an unidentified heavyset Hispanic man, exit the rear of the apartment building, and enter the green Audi. The defendant drove in an evasive manner. The Audi was met by an unidentified man and woman. The woman entered the Audi, and after a short ride, was dropped off. Upon return to the apartment building parking lot, the defendant exited the Audi, walked over to the Toyota, and looked about to see if he were being watched. The defendant entered the Toyota, and opened the engine hood. Again, the defendant looked around to see if he were being watched. The defendant either placed something in, or took something out of, the Toyota engine compartment. Then, the defendant moved the Toyota to a spot that blocked the Audi. In another such surveillance, on April 4, 2005, the police observed the defendant exit the rear of the apartment building and walk directly to the Audi, which he opened with a key. The defendant drove the Audi to meet with an unidentified female, who entered the Audi, and was dropped off after a short ride. When he returned to the apartment parking lot, the defendant again exited the Audi, and used another key to unlock the Toyota. The defendant went into the Toyota's interior for a brief time.

Further indicating that the defendant used the two cars as
Page 276
tools of his trade, the defendant masked his connection to the two cars. The Audi was registered in the defendant's girlfriend's name and the Toyota was registered to another individual, who had a heroin distribution criminal record. This pattern suggests that the two cars were being used not only to transport, but also to store, heroin. It is reasonable to infer that the defendant engaged in a shell game of driving one car to the prearranged site, while using the other car as a storage location, and then alternating the cases and the cars' purposes. There were far more probable cause connections to the cars, as described in the affidavit, than in the scant descriptions associated with the apartment building.
The majority looks to Commonwealth v. O'Day,
, as support for a probable cause nexus to the apartment building. In my opinion, the O'Day case tends to demonstrate no such probable cause. In O'Day, the only significant affidavit information similar to this case is that there were three controlled buys by an informant. But, in most other material respects, the O'Day case is markedly different because the O'Day search warrant affidavit had many more links to the residence than are present in this case.
Most significantly, in the O'Day case, the Supreme Judicial Court cited two police surveillances indicating sales from within O'Day's residence as establishing probable cause that controlled substances were stored in that residence. In one police surveillance of O'Day's residence, the officers saw a number of visitors arrive and depart after a very brief stay. Commonwealth v. O'Day, supra at 299. Given the quick visits by this series of individuals to O'Day's residence, the affidavit included a police officer's expert opinion that the behavior was ""consistent with narcotics distribution."" Ibid. A second police surveillance of O'Day's residence confirmed ""the same pattern of visitors to the defendant's residence as on the previous occasion: 'several vehicles that arrived and departed . . . after a brief stay.' "" Id. at 300.
this parade of visitors briefly entering and exiting O'Day's residence that the Supreme Judicial Court found critical
Page 277
in the probable cause calculus of nexus to the residence.
the informant's three controlled buys from O'Day away from O'Day's residence that established the connection. To that end, the court made clear in O'Day that ""the details provided by the confidential informant, standing alone, did not establish a nexus between [O'Day's] drug activity and his residence, [it was rather] the additional information gathered by the State troopers during their surveillance and investigation [that] established probable cause"" (emphasis added). Id. at 302. In contrast, in this case, virtually all of the argument for nexus to the apartment rests on the four controlled buys away from the apartment building.
In further contrast to the O'Day case, here, there was no information in the affidavit that the defendant was using the apartment to sell drugs to random and brief visitors. Nor did the affidavit contain corroborative investigative information linking the residence to illegal conduct, such as was set forth in the O'Day affidavit. To illustrate the major differences: as set forth in the O'Day affidavit (beyond the sales at the residence already described), the investigation also revealed a series of sales by O'Day to a number of buyers at the pub where he worked. In this respect, the O'Day affidavit refers to one pub surveillance where there were ""a series of exchanges beneath a table in the bar [between O'Day and] several individuals."" Id. at 229. In another surveillance at the pub, there were several police observations of potential buyers going into the men's room with O'Day for a short period of time, as if a deal had just occurred. Id. at 300. Given all of this additional information -- beyond the three controlled buys to the informant -- the Supreme Judicial Court in O'Day concluded that the number of transactions and quantity of drugs being sold on divers dates by the O'Day enterprise gave rise to probable cause that cocaine was stored at O'Day's residence. Specifically, the O'Day court wrote as follows:
""During two surveillances, the defendant was observed departing from his residence in his truck, proceeding directly to [the pub], and engaging therein in what appeared to be drug transactions. The reasonable inference was that the defendant brought a substantial quantity of
Page 278
drugs with him to the pub. It was unlikely that the defendant obtained the drugs from within the bar, as the defendant argues, or from any other location because he was constantly watched by the officers. It appeared that the drugs were transported in the truck, to which he returned to replenish his supply.
(emphasis added).
Id. at 303.

        None of this is present in the affidavit in this case. Unlike the O'Day case, there are no sales by the defendant other than the four controlled buys. There is not, in this case, a large number of buys or substantial drug sales. There is no evidence of a large-scale drug enterprise. Rather, what the search warrant affidavit devolves to is four ""small time"" controlled buys by an informant: (1) a buy of ""one"" for forty dollars on March 28, 2005; (2) a buy of ""one"" for sixty dollars on March 29, 2005; (3) a buy of ""two"" for $100 on April 4, 2005; and (4) a buy of ""one"" for sixty dollars on April 8, 2005. (As previously referenced, see note 1, supra, these four controlled buys were not a part of the trial, and not the basis for any of the defendant's convictions.)
Because the trial was based on the heroin, cocaine, and guns and ammunition seized under the warrant, and not the controlled buys by the informant, it is true that allowance of the defendant's motion to suppress on the basis that the search warrant affidavit did not establish probable cause nexus to the apartment building means that a man who had a large cache of heroin (30.96 grams), a smaller, but not insignificant, amount of cocaine, and handguns will have his convictions vacated.
That is troubling, especially since had there been more targeted law
Page 279
enforcement surveillance -- such as establishing a surveillance point at the apartment building prior to the four controlled buys, watching the defendant's activities on more occasions than was done here, and undertaking additional, corroborative investigative work in this case -- gaps would have been filled, and a probable cause nexus may very well have been built into the search warrant affidavit with connections to the defendant's apartment building. But courts must not fill in probable cause blanks. Thus, although this dissent would lead to an untoward end in that a large amount of drugs and guns would be suppressed under the exclusionary rule, in the final judicial analysis, I set the lodestar for this dissent in the words that resonate with fundamental constitutional power in the Fourth Amendment
and art. 14.
""[C]onviction by means of unlawful seizures and enforced confessions . . . should find no sanction in the judgments of the courts . . . . The efforts of the courts and their officials to bring the guilty to punishment, praiseworthy as they are, are not to be aided by the sacrifice of those great principles established by years of endeavor and suffering which have resulted in their embodiment in the fundamental law of the land."" Weeks v. United States, 232 U.S. 383, 392-393 (1914). Accord Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 655 (1961) (holding the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule applicable to the States).
Page 280
For all of the reasons set forth herein, I dissent from the majority's holding that the search warrant affidavit established a probable cause nexus to the defendant's apartment building.

 COMMONWEALTH vs. RONALD PODGURSKI.,"Controlled Substances. Entrapment. Evidence, Exculpatory, Scientific test.
At the trial of indictments charging offenses involving controlled substances, the judge abused her discretion in excluding pertinent testimony at trial through which the defendant sought to set forth the necessary foundation of an entrapment defense, i.e., evidence of what, if anything, was promised to an alleged police informant and evidence of alleged coercion of the defendant by the informant to demonstrate inducement that amounted to more than solicitation. [182-185]
At the trial of indictments charging offenses involving controlled substances, the judge erred in permitting a police detective, during his testimony, to weigh drugs manually on a police department scale, where the Commonwealth did not set forth sufficient foundational evidence of the scale's accuracy. [185-187]
INDICTMENTS found and returned in the Superior Court Department on January 6, 2006.
The cases were tried before Barbara A. Dortch-Okara, J.
Tatum A. Pritchard for the defendant.
Suzanne D. McDonough, Assistant District Attorney, for the Commonwealth.","
The defendant appeals from convictions of trafficking in more than twenty-eight grams of oxycodone, in violation of G. L. c. 94C, § 32E(b); possession with intent to distribute oxycodone, G. L. c. 94C, § 32A(c); and, as lesser included offenses of charges of possession with intent to distribute, simple possession of hydrocodone and marijuana, G. L. c. 94C, § 34.

Page 176
The defendant contends that the trial judge made several erroneous rulings that resulted in prejudice, namely (1) the exclusion of evidence of, and refusal to give certain instructions on, entrapment; and (2) the allowance of a police witness to weigh oxycodone pills using an untested police scale.
As we agree that the judge improperly prevented the defendant from developing evidence significant to his defense of entrapment, we must reverse his convictions of trafficking in oxycodone and of possession of oxycodone with intent to distribute.
We affirm the remaining convictions.

1. Background. a. The offenses. During the Commonwealth's case, evidence was introduced indicating the following facts. In September, 2005, detectives of the Brockton police department began surveillance of the defendant's residence on Plain Street. During cross-examination, Brockton Detective Robert Morrissey testified that he was wholly unfamiliar with the defendant's residence or his voice until October 5, 2005, on the occasion of a meeting arranged by a police informant. At the meeting on October 5, Morrissey, working undercover, met the defendant for the first time, at the home of the defendant, where Morrissey and the informant proceeded to purchase several Percocet pills from the defendant. Morrissey obtained the defendant's telephone number at that time.

On the next day, October 6, 2005, at around 11:20 A.M., Brockton detectives set up surveillance around the defendant's residence. Morrissey, using the number he had been provided the day before, placed a telephone call to the defendant to initiate an undercover purchase of Percocet, using fifty dollars of department-issued currency that he marked. During the call, Morrissey asked the defendant if he could ""pick up eight
Page 177
[P]ercocets."" The defendant instructed Morrissey to come to the house and later was present to receive Morrissey and conduct the transaction.
Morrissey testified that he saw no one else in the home at this time.
After Morrissey left the house, he returned to the Brockton police station while surveillance officers, Detectives Stanton and Diliddo, continued to watch the defendant's residence. Less than one hour after Morrissey completed the purchase from the defendant, the defendant left his house. Stanton conducted a proper automobile stop, at which the defendant was given Miranda warnings, pat frisked, and ultimately placed under arrest. Diliddo searched the defendant's car and discovered a pill bottle containing seventeen pills, and a clear plastic bag with forty-eight pills on the front passenger seat.
During a search of the defendant during booking, Stanton found seventy-eight dollars in the defendant's wallet, among which were two one-dollar bills and one ten-dollar bill that Morrissey later identified as marked money used to make his purchase from the defendant.
Pursuant to a valid search warrant, officers searched the defendant's home and uncovered a number of illegal substances in pill form hidden throughout the apartment.
In addition, Lieutenant O'Connell found marijuana inside a green trash bag
Page 178
in a hallway adjacent to the living room.
Other paraphernalia indicative of drug dealing were found.

At trial, and over continued objection, Morrissey opened each heat-sealed bag of oxycodone and weighed it on a triple-beam scale belonging to the Brockton police department. Prior to making his measurements, Morrissey explained that one would first bring the scale to a zero reading before weighing any substance on it: ""You zero out the scale to make sure it's balanced correctly,"" by turning ""an adjustment screw in the back . . . to calibrate it to the surface which the scale lays on."" After testifying that the scale ""appears to be calibrated to me,""
Morrissey then weighed each set of pills on the scale, testified to their measured weight, and counted aloud the number of pills. The prosecutor simultaneously noted the weight on a chalk used to assist the jury. In this manner, the Commonwealth presented the total weight of the oxycodone at trial as 54.7 grams.
The defendant agreed during his testimony that Morrissey and another individual came to his home on October 5, the day before his arrest and the execution of the search warrant. The defendant testified that the third individual was a male named George Dukakis from whom he had purchased Vicodin for about one year and who the defendant at times had seen carry guns. The defendant stated that on that day, while Morrissey remained in the living room, he and Dukakis had a conversation in the kitchen. As a result of this conversation, the defendant testified, he was frightened. When the men returned to the living room,
Page 179
the defendant produced four Vicodin pills and split them up between Dukakis and Morrissey.
The defendant further testified that on the next day, October 6, a man whose name he did not know, but whom the defendant had seen before in the company of Dukakis, arrived at his house and gave him a bag of Oxycontin and a bag of Percocets. The defendant admitted that later that morning, when Morrissey arrived at the defendant's residence, he gave Morrissey some of the Percocets he had received earlier that day, but the defendant maintained that he did so because he was afraid for his family. Later that day, when police stopped the defendant and recovered seventeen Oxycontin and forty-eight Percocets, the defendant admitted he was on his way to Norwood to meet with Dukakis, and intended to deliver the pills to Dukakis because the defendant was afraid for his children. The defendant maintained that he had no underlying intention of selling the pills.
b. Development of entrapment as defense at trial. The defendant first attempted to raise the issue of entrapment, and specifically the nature of the relationship between Morrissey and Dukakis, during his cross-examination of Morrissey. Morrissey identified the individual who accompanied him inside the defendant's residence on October 5, 2005, only as an informant.
The defendant attempted to delve into the relationship between Morrissey and the informant by inquiring as to Morrissey's familiarity and prior interactions with the informant, for the purpose of establishing a possible foundation upon which the jury could hold Morrissey responsible for the actions of the informant as his agent. However, the judge excluded all such inquiries, including the name or identity of the informant, on the ground of relevance.
At the ensuing side bar conference, defense counsel explained that the elicitation of information pertaining to this relationship represented an attempt to establish, in connection with his defense, that ""Dukakis was in fact the moving force behind this entire event."" Upon the judge's relevance query, counsel suggested further that if Morrissey knew the informant, that
Page 180
knowledge may have arisen from a prior arrest of Dukakis, and such circumstances would necessarily have on effect on whether there existed any coercion on the informant, which would raise an issue of entrapment. However, the trial judge remained unpersuaded. When counsel subsequently inquired of Morrissey whether ""[t]he person that you went to the house with on October the 5th of 2005, that person had been arrested for drug events,"" the judge sustained the Commonwealth's objection. When told to move on, counsel responded, ""This is my defense, Judge."" Counsel then attempted to inquire of Morrissey about the informant's possible background in a motorcycle gang but this area of questioning was also excluded.
During the defense case, the defendant attempted to introduce the conversation between Dukakis and the defendant to show its coercive nature and the state of mind of the defendant as relevant to meeting the evidentiary threshold for an entrapment defense. During the defendant's direct testimony, his counsel began to explore the events that took place at the meeting between the defendant and Dukakis and Morrissey on October 5. The defendant identified Dukakis as his year-long source of Vicodin pills. Then, describing the conversation between him and Dukakis that took place after they moved into the kitchen and without Morrissey present, the defendant was permitted to testify that Dukakis ""said that he needed to take care of his pills. He said I gotta have you take them out there. This guy [Morrissey] is a customer of my brother's . . . and . . . I don't want him to know I've got anything."" When asked what the defendant recalled as the next event to take place, the defendant answered that Dukakis said, ""I need to have you store my stuff,"" drawing an objection. The judge instructed the jury to disregard this answer in totality and for counsel to move on.

Outside the presence of the jury, the judge permitted defense
Page 181
counsel to explain his proposed defense of entrapment. Counsel argued that, as an agent of the Commonwealth, Dukakis worked as an informant with the police, making efforts to introduce Morrissey to the defendant. Moreover, defense counsel asserted that Dukakis was the reason for the defendant's commission of certain offenses alleged by the police, specifically, selling Percocets to Morrissey on October 6 and trafficking in the oxycodone pills found in the defendant's vehicle and in his home.
Further, to show the existence of coercive motivation and threats, defense counsel proffered that Dukakis is or was a member of a motorcycle gang in the city of Brockton, ""the Outlaws,"" and that Dukakis allegedly threatened the defendant that he would cease selling Vicodin to the defendant if the defendant did not engage in this drug-selling activity. Defense counsel averred that Dukakis supported this threat with the statement that Dukakis ""kn[ew] exactly who your [the defendant's] family is and where your [the defendant's] family lives and I will take care of it."" According to counsel, the threats were intended to ""get [the defendant] to go along with this scheme which was an effort [by Dukakis] to get himself out of trouble and set somebody up."" Counsel offered further that the proposed testimony from the defendant would reveal that Dukakis arranged for the defendant to receive the oxycodone pills, directing the defendant to bring to Dukakis the collections of pills that were found in the car by the police.
Finally, when asked by the court to explain why the government would be responsible for the actions of Dukakis, counsel
Page 182
explained that, as an informant, Dukakis provided the police officer with information, brought the officer to the defendant's home, cooperated with the officer to retrieve illegal pills from the defendant, and, finally, engaged in activity that was designedto entrap the defendant. After counsel made this proffer, the trial judge ruled that she would not allow additional evidence on this issue, as she did not preliminarily find that a sufficient connection had been shown with police in this transaction.
2. Discussion. a. Entrapment. The defendant argues that the judge erred in excluding pertinent testimony at trial and in failing to instruct the jury on the defense. With regard to the former, the defendant avers the judge directly prevented the defendant from introducing evidence that an informant of Detective Morrissey coerced the defendant to possess oxycodone, thereby establishing a sufficient foundation for an entrapment instruction. In particular, the defendant cites the judge's prohibition of any testimony pertaining to the informant's relationship with Detective Morrissey, and of the contents of any conversation between the informant and the defendant to show a spoken threat as the coercive basis of his actions.
Entrapment by law enforcement involves ""implanting criminal ideas in innocent minds and thereby bringing about offenses that otherwise would never have been perpetrated."" Commonwealth v. Shuman,
, 351 (1984), quoting Perkins, Criminal Law 1031 (2d ed. 1969). ""There are two elements of the entrapment defense: (1) that the defendant was induced by a government agent or one acting at his direction and (2) that the defendant lacked predisposition to engage in the criminal conduct of which he is accused."" Commonwealth v. Madigan,
, 707 (2007), quoting from Commonwealth v. Penta,
, 47 (1992). The defendant only bears an ""initial burden 'of producing some evidence of inducement by the government.' . . . The burden then shifts to the Commonwealth 'to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) there was no government inducement or (2) the defendant was predisposed to commit the crime.' "" Madigan, supra, quoting from Penta, supra.
Before reaching the inducement inquiry, the defense of entrapment requires the defendant to introduce evidence that the inducer
Page 183
is a ""government agent or one acting at his direction."" Commonwealth v. Miller,
, 651- 652 (1972). As such, ""[a]n individual's actions will not be attributed to the State if no promises are made for that individual's help and if nothing was offered to or asked of that individual."" Commonwealth v. Rancourt,
, 274 (1987). To this end it becomes necessary for the defendant to show the nature of the relationship between the government and the informant, since ""[c]ooperation with the government in hope of favor is not sufficient; something is to be offered to or asked of the individual claimed to be the government agent."" Commonwealth v. Colon,
, 305 (1992).
As the ""threshold for a defendant to raise the entrapment issue is low,"" Madigan, supra, quoting from Commonwealth v. Tracey,
, 536 (1993), the defense ""is appropriately raised . . . by the introduction of some evidence of inducement by a government agent or one acting at his direction."" Miller, supra. The court will consider the sufficiency of all evidence, ""even if the evidence is unsubstantial and even if the evidence comes solely from the defendant's testimony,"" Tracey, supra, ""but little more than solicitation is required to raise the issue."" Miller, supra at 652.

""Whether evidence is relevant and whether its probative value is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect are matters entrusted to the trial judge's broad discretion and are not disturbed absent palpable error."" Commonwealth v. Sylvia,
, 192 (2010), quoting from Commonwealth v. Simpson,
, 578-579 (2001). See Mass. G. Evid. §§ 401-403 (2011). We hold that such error occurred when the judge excluded both cross-examination of Detective Morrissey and the portion of direct examination of the defendant discussing his conversation with Dukakis. Each area of evidence will be discussed in turn.
Page 184
Here, the defendant attempted, during cross-examination of Detective Morrissey, to inquire into the relationship between Morrissey and Dukakis. Such purpose was apparent in the line of questioning directed toward Morrissey about his knowledge of Dukakis's background and past criminality. Exclusion of this entire line of inquiry wholly prevented the defendant from setting forth the necessary foundation to present evidence of what, if anything, was promised to Dukakis as an alleged informant in this case.
In Madigan, the defendant's need for an opportunity to probe the police-informant relationship was discussed. The Supreme Judicial Court stated that the ""[f]ailure to disclose information about the relationship, if any, between [the informant] and law enforcement or information as to any promises or inducements made to [the informant] by the government would defeat the defendant's ability to establish his defense of entrapment."" Madigan, 449 Mass. at 709.
Notwithstanding that Madigan related to a request for pretrial disclosure of an informant's identity, the defendant's attempt in the instant case to inquire into the relationship between Morrissey and Dukakis is similar to the situation in Madigan, where ""[t]he defendant asserts that [the informant] was acting as an agent for, or at least at the direction of, the police. The assertion, if true, has a direct relationship to his entrapment defense because entrapment focuses on 'evidence of inducement by a government agent or one acting at his direction' "" (footnote omitted). Id. at 708-709, quoting from Tracey, 416 Mass. at 537 n.10. Information pertaining to the relationship between Morrissey and Dukakis and relating to the defendant, if it exists, is essential to establish the defendant's claim that the government induced him to commit crimes. See Colon, 33 Mass. App. Ct. at 305 (necessary for entrapment defense to establish inducer is government agent). Contrast Commonwealth v. Rancourt, 399 Mass. at 273 (motion judge correctly concluded no agency relationship had been established between government and fellow inmate of defendant, who had been told by police ""that if he obtained any other information and wanted to relay that information, he should telephone or write to the district attorney's office"").
Likewise, during testimony of the defendant, the judge erred
Page 185
in excluding the content of the defendant's kitchen conversation with Dukakis, as it bore on the defendant's state of mind. As it was recognized in Commonwealth v. Thompson,
, 383 (1981), ""[the defendant's] proffered testimony, which related to [the informant]'s solicitation of him, . . . was relevant and admissible."" ""When, as here, a statement is not offered to prove the truth of the words but to show inducement, the statement is not inadmissible on the ground of hearsay."" Id. at 384, citing Brown v. State, 299 So. 2d 37, 38 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1974), cert. denied, 310 So. 2d 740 (Fla. 1975) (testimony regarding conversations between defendant and government informant was not hearsay because it was offered ""not to prove the truth of the matter asserted, but rather to show the appellant's state of mind and the inducement of the confidential informant"").
In the instant case, the defendant sought to present evidence of alleged coercion to demonstrate inducement that amounted to more than solicitation. Such inducement is required to meet the ""low threshold"" to raise the entrapment defense. Where the exclusion of the line of questions during the cross- examination of Detective Morrissey was error because it prevented the defendant from exploring the nature of the government-informant relationship, the exclusion of the defendant's testimony blocked information as to the defendant's state of mind, an issue material to the underlying inducement or coercion.
As both lines of inquiry were relevant to these foundational requirements of entrapment, and since there was no superseding basis to exclude the questioning (see Mass. G. Evid. §§ 401-402 [2011]), these rulings amounted to an abuse of the judge's otherwise broad discretion in matters of the admission of evidence. Reversal is required.
b. In-court weighing of drugs. Further, we conclude the judge erred in permitting Detective Morrissey, during his testimony, to weigh the drugs manually on a police department scale without laying a proper foundation for admitting Morrissey's testimony regarding the weight of the drugs. As such, this error effectively relieved the Commonwealth of its burden of establishing the
Page 186
weight of drugs beyond a reasonable doubt. As this issue may reoccur at the new trial, we address it below.
Where a measuring device is at issue, the courts in Massachusetts have required the party proffering a measurement at trial to present sufficient evidence to satisfy a threshold showing that the device is accurate. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Torres,
, 737 (2009) (officer testified that during same month as offenses he had ""calibrated the MeasureMaster [roller tape] by using it to measure a known distance, and that the device was accurate""). See also Commonwealth v. Whynaught,
, 19 (1979) (""some foundation requirement pertaining to the accuracy of the particular radar instrument is appropriate in order to ensure that the persuasive force of scientific results is not improperly triggered""); Commonwealth v. Whitlock,
, 327 (2009) (""Testimony about the nature of the tool and the manner in which the witness used it either provides or fails to provide a foundation for admission of the resulting observation"").
Cf. Police Dept. of Groveland v. Gallant,
, 913 (2010) (unobjected-to admission into evidence of readings from ""calibrated mounted radar unit"" left only the issue of weight not admissibility of evidence).
Contrary to the cases set forth above, the instant record is devoid of any evidence that the Commonwealth demonstrated the accuracy of the scale or that the scale at issue was sufficiently calibrated, consistent with Massachusetts law. The Commonwealth identifies the following evidence as indicative of calibration: that the scale remained in the possession of the police department for fifteen years prior to trial; that Detective Morrissey ""zeroed"" the scale at trial
; that Morrissey was
Page 187
trained to use the scale; and finally that the jury observed the measurements in plain sight. However, without the scale's accuracy being tested against a known quantity, we conclude this evidence was inadequate.

It is undisputed that the scale had never been the subject of testing by any outside agency of the city or Commonwealth, nor had the officer ever tested its accuracy by weighing an object of known weight. Such methods, if employed, might have shown the device was accurate. Indeed, measurement against a known quantity is consistent with the dictionary definition of ""calibrate"": ""[t]o check, adjust, or determine by comparison with a standard (the graduations of a quantitative measuring instrument)."" American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 264 (4th ed. 2006). Thus, where the record is silent on any comparison involving a test object of known measure, we conclude the Commonwealth did not set forth sufficient foundational evidence of accuracy, thereby rendering the weights measured by the scale inadmissible.
3. Conclusion. While the defense of entrapment may have been one that the jury would have rejected out of hand, it was improper for the judge, given the low threshold evidentiary standard, to limit the defendant from developing it adequately. On the indictments charging the defendant with trafficking in and distribution of oxycodone, the judgments are reversed, the verdicts are set aside, and further proceedings shall be held in conformity with this opinion. The remaining judgments are affirmed.

A Boston Municipal Court judge erred in denying a criminal defendant's motion to suppress a firearm and ammunition discovered in an automobile when, after conducting a patfrisk of the defendant based on a tip provided by unknown informants, police officers obtained the defendant's consent to search the vehicle, where, in the absence of any police corroboration of the unknown informants' tip, the stop of the defendant was impermissable, and the record did not show sufficient attenuation (i.e., the police did not advise the defendant of his right to refuse consent, no significant time elapsed between the stop and the consent, and no intervening event occurred) of the illegal search and the illegal seizure of the defendant to warrant a finding that the defendant's consent was an act of free will, unaffected by the taint of the illegality.

We reverse.
1. Motion to suppress. a. The record and the findings. Three witnesses, the defendant, Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) police Sergeant Detective John Mahoney, and MBTA police Detective Patrick Lewis, testified at the hearing on the defendant's motion to suppress. Before reciting the motion judge's findings, we summarize the testimony ""that was 'uncontroverted and undisputed and [that] the judge explicitly or implicitly credited.' "" Commonwealth v. Ocasio,
, 305, cert. denied, 555 U.S. 931 (2008), quoting from Commonwealth v. Isaiah I.,
, 337 (2007).

On the morning of May 29, 2008, Sergeant Detective Mahoney, who was in charge of the MBTA's internal security unit, received a telephone call from Richard Hart, the MBTA's manager of station maintenance with a supervisory responsibility over the MBTA's contract cleaners. Hart said he had ""received information"" from an unnamed source or sources that ""there was a contract cleaner, the foreman, who works at North Station [in Boston] that was carrying a gun while working on the property and possibly, that he may have two guns and he was known to carry one in the . . . small of his back and possibly one in his car."" According to Hart, the foreman's name was Arias and
Page 344
he ""drove a BMW [automobile], silver and blue, with no license plate."" Sergeant Detective Mahoney ""informed Officer Lewis of the information he had received, gave him Mr. Hart's phone number and told him to call [Hart] back and get all pertinent information that he could from him.""
Officer Lewis contacted Hart and another MBTA employee named Halloran, who also had a supervisory role over contract cleaners. Without identifying the sources of their information, Hart and Halloran told Officer Lewis that ""other people""
had informed them that the defendant, one of the contract cleaners, ""may be in possession of a firearm."" They then provided Lewis with information regarding the defendant, including his name, where he worked, the type of vehicle that he had been seen driving, his date of birth, and ""stuff like that based on his employment records."" Hart and Halloran also told Officer Lewis that the defendant's shift was from 11:30 P.M. to 7:30 A.M., and that contract cleaning supervisors like the defendant were required to report to an MBTA office at Downtown Crossing in Boston at approximately 11:00 P.M. before going to their assigned work locations.
Relying on the information provided to him by Hart and Halloran, but without ascertaining the identities of or speaking to the ""other people"" from whom Hart and Halloran had obtained their information, Sergeant Detective Mahoney went to Downtown Crossing at 11:00 P.M. There he saw a parked silver and blue BMW. From the license plate on the vehicle, he learned that the car was registered to a woman who lived at an address that matched the address for the defendant Hart had provided. A search of other records revealed that the defendant had not been issued a firearms license.
So informed, Sergeant Detective Mahoney, Officer Lewis, and a third MBTA police officer, Detective Michael Cauley, proceeded to North Station where they saw the BMW parked and unoccupied on an access road. Sergeant Detective Mahoney and Officer Lewis parked fifty to sixty yards away in an unmarked
Page 345
cruiser, while Detective Cauley waited and watched from another location.
At some point between 11:30 P.M. and 1:00 A.M., the officers saw the defendant come out of a nearby building, walk to the BMW, and open either the passenger side door or the trunk several times. Around 1:00 A.M., the defendant returned to the car, opened the passenger door and sat down in the passenger seat to put on work boots. At that point, Sergeant Detective Mahoney approached him, with Officer Lewis close behind. Sergeant Detective Mahoney displayed his badge and the officers identified themselves as MBTA police. The officers were in plain clothes and, although armed, they did not draw their weapons.
Sergeant Detective Mahoney testified that, as he drew near, he asked to speak to the defendant. ""At that time, he stood up. I informed him that we had information that there was a gentleman that worked there carrying a firearm and was the foreman of the crew. I told him for his safety, I was just going to do a pat down of him. He nodded his head affirmatively. I patted him down and found no other firearm. And then we asked if we could search the vehicle.""
The defendant said, ""yes,"" or ""yes, go ahead,"" or ""yes, you may,"" or ""go ahead, search the car. You can search the car.""
Officer Lewis and Detective Cauley then began to search the defendant's car. Officer Lewis found a loaded pistol beneath a floor mat under the driver's seat and ""yelled 'gun.' "" Upon hearing that, the defendant immediately said, ""I found it."" In response, Sergeant Detective Mahoney asked, ""what did you say,"" to which the defendant responded, ""I found it. I saw a gentleman running down Causeway Street and he threw something down. I went over to see what it was and when I picked it up, it was the gun. And I was going to call the police but I didn't. I just put it in the car.""

The defendant was then handcuffed and Officer Lewis walked
Page 346
him to a nearby cruiser, reciting the Miranda warnings as he did. The defendant ""acknowledged"" the warnings.
Officer Lewis placed him in the cruiser's rear seat and then asked him ""what happened,"" whereupon the defendant essentially repeated the account he had given in response to Sergeant Detective Mahoney's question.
On that record, the motion judge denied the defendant's motion to suppress with the following oral findings:
""After a hearing and based on the credible evidence, this Court makes findings and rulings which include but are not limited to the following. The Defendant . . . admits he had a firearm loaded with ammunition in his motor vehicle. He argues that the police violated his right to be free from illegal search and seizure under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights when the police located that loaded firearm by searching his motor vehicle without a warrant and without his permission.
""Because this Court credits the testimony of Sergeant Detective John Mahoney and Detective Patrick Lewis, that the Defendant while not under arrest, consented to the search of his motor vehicle which resulted in the discovery of the firearm and ammunition, the Defendant's motion to suppress is denied.
""The Defendant had a firearm loaded with ammunition in his car. The police had good intelligence that the Defendant may have a firearm or firearms. The police made a threshold inquiry of the Defendant and told him they had information that he may have a gun. The police pat frisked the Defendant for their safety. The police asked the Defendant if they could search his car. The Defendant consented to the search. Detective Lewis Mirandized the Defendant orally, properly, after the firearm was located.
""The Defendant made statements after Miranda which include but are not limited to that he found the gun and
Page 347
put it in his car. The Court notes that additional findings and rulings will be made upon the filing of a Notice of Appeal.""

b. Discussion. On the record just described, the defendant argues that the Commonwealth has not satisfied its burden of proving that any consent he may have given for the search of his vehicle
was untainted by what he characterizes as the unlawful stop and frisk by which it was preceded. We agree. In so doing, we accept the motion judge's findings of fact absent clear error, but independently review her conclusions of law. See Commonwealth v. Washington,
, 480 (2007).
""[A] 'stop and frisk [is] constitutionally permissible if two conditions are met. First, the investigatory stop must be lawful.' "" Commonwealth v. Narcisse,
, 7 (2010), quoting from Arizona v. Johnson, 555 U.S. 323, 326 (2009). ""Second, to proceed from a stop to a frisk, the police officer must reasonably suspect that the person stopped is armed and dangerous."" Ibid.
There can be no doubt that the defendant was ""stopped"" in a constitutional sense before the search of his vehicle occurred. A ""stop"" is a form of seizure and a person is seized for purposes of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution when, ""in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave."" United States v. Mendenhall, 446 U.S. 544, 554 (1980). See Commonwealth v. Stoute,
, 785-789 (1996) (adopting the Mendenhall standard for art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights). In this case, those circumstances existed no later than the point at which Sergeant Detective Mahoney told the defendant that he intended to conduct a frisk.
See Commonwealth v. DePeiza,
,
Page 348
371 (2007); Commonwealth v. Narcisse, 457 Mass. at 6 (""once the officers told the defendant that they intended to pat frisk him, they seized his person within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment and art. 14"").
A stop is lawful only if the police have ""an objectively reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, based on specific and articulable facts."" Commonwealth v. Barros,
, 176 (2001). When reasonable suspicion is based on an informant's tip, the tip must bear adequate indicia of reliability, i.e., ""the Commonwealth must show the basis of knowledge of the source of the information (the basis of knowledge test) and the underlying circumstances demonstrating that the source of the information was credible or the information reliable (veracity test)."" Commonwealth v. Lopes,
, 155-156 (2009).

Here, the record reveals nothing about the informants' basis of knowledge or veracity. Hart and Halloran, the MBTA employees who told the police about the defendant, expressly stated that they were passing on information they had obtained from ""other people"" but said nothing about who the other people were and provided no information about the other people that would enable anyone to determine either their veracity or basis of knowledge. In that regard, we treat the individuals who gave information to Hart and Halloran as unknown informants even though police knew their identities by the time of the hearing. See note 3, supra. Nothing in the record suggests that the police knew who the informants were before they arrested the defendant or that they had any idea how the informants knew of the gun. Moreover, information obtained from known informants receives somewhat greater weight than that received from anonymous informants because known informants expose themselves to ""charge[s] of filing a false report or any comparable consequence of providing false information to law enforcement.""
Page 349
Commonwealth v. Mubdi,
, 397 (2010). See Commonwealth v. Costa,
, 515-517 (2007). Here, the informants faced no such consequences when they made their disclosures to Hart or Halloran. Indeed, nothing in the record suggests that they even knew that Hart or Halloran would relay their information to authorities.
When there is insufficient evidence to show an informant's basis of knowledge and veracity, ""[i]ndependent police corroboration may make up for deficiencies in one or both of these factors."" Commonwealth v. Barros, 435 Mass. at 176, quoting from Commonwealth v. Lyons,
, 19 (1990). Corroboration of that sort, though, must show that the informant has knowledge related to the criminal activity, not mere ""innocent details."" Id. at 177 n.7. See Florida v. J.L., 529 U.S. 266, 272 (2000) (a tip must be ""reliable in its assertion of illegality, not just in its tendency to identify a determinate person"").
No such corroboration is present here. To be sure, Hart and Halloran told the police about the defendant's work schedule and the officers saw him appear at the times and places the schedule dictated.
But Hart and Halloran had supervisory responsibilities for contract cleaners like the defendant and surely would have known his work schedule, regardless of the knowledge or veracity underlying the original tips. In addition, Officer Lewis testified that some information Hart and Halloran provided came from employment records and, apart from information about the pistol, the record does not distinguish between the information coming from those records and information gained from the unknown informants. Moreover, police corroboration of informant information bolsters the reliability and veracity of that information to the extent that it tends to show the informant's knowledge of ""inside activity"" that has some relevance to the unlawful behavior the informants are reporting. See Commonwealth v. Mubdi, 456 Mass. at 397-398. Police corroboration of information in employment records, on
Page 350
the other hand, tends to show accurate record keeping or faithful employment, not criminal activity.
The stop was therefore impermissible and the stop and frisk are analytically inseparable. Thus the question becomes whether the Commonwealth has satisfied its burden of showing that the defendant's consent to the automobile search was ""free and voluntary,"" Commonwealth v. Yehudi Y.,
, 816 (2002), that is, ""unfettered by coercion, express or implied, and . . . something more than mere 'acquiescence to a claim of lawful authority.' "" Commonwealth v. Voisine,
, 783 (1993), quoting from Commonwealth v. Walker,
, 555, cert. denied, 429 U.S. 943 (1976). ""Consent to search obtained through exploitation of a prior illegality, particularly very close in time following the prior illegality, has not been regarded as freely given unless the taint of the illegality has been attenuated. . . . It is the burden of the Commonwealth to prove that the taint has been sufficiently attenuated to allow the admission of the evidence derived from the prior illegality."" Commonwealth v. Allen,
, 721-722 (2002).
Insofar as dissipation of the taint is concerned, we think that this case is indistinguishable from Commonwealth v. Loughlin,
(1982). There, after engaging in what the court determined to be an impermissible detention of a pickup truck driver and passenger and an impermissible patfrisk of the passenger, the officer asked the driver whether there were any weapons in the truck's passenger compartment. In response, the driver said, ""No weapons. You can check."" Id. at 62. The officer did, and found nothing. He then asked whether there were any weapons in the back of the vehicle. Again the driver answered, ""No, you can check."" Again the officer searched, this time finding marijuana, which led to the charges on which the driver and passenger were convicted. Ibid.
In ruling that the search was impermissible, the Supreme Judicial Court stated, ""[t]he record does not show sufficient attenuation of the illegal search of [the passenger] and the illegal seizure of [the driver and passenger] to warrant a finding that [the driver's] consent was an act of free will, unaffected by the taint of the illegality. . . . The trooper did not advise [the driver] of his right to refuse to consent to the search. No
Page 351
significant time elapsed between the illegality and the 'consent.' No intervening event occurred that dissipated the effect of the illegality."" Id. at 63-64.
The same reasoning and result apply here.
On this record it was error to deny the motion to suppress. The firearm and the ammunition it contained should not have been admitted at trial and no discussion is required to show that admission of either or both was not ""harmless beyond a reasonable doubt."" Commonwealth v. Tyree,
, 700 (2010), quoting from Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967).
2. Other claims. The defendant's other claims require far less discussion. We need not resolve his claim that the trial judge should have held an evidentiary hearing on the voluntariness of his statements.
If there is to be a retrial and if the voluntariness of those statements remains a live issue, the voluntariness should be explored and a humane practice instruction given. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Cryer,
, 571 (1998); Commonwealth v. Miller,
, 835 n.1 (2007).
Sergeant Detective Mahoney and Officer Lewis should not have been permitted to testify, over objection, that the defendant was known to carry a firearm and that he would be driving a blue and silver BMW from Downtown Crossing to North Station.
The testimony was hearsay, perhaps totem pole hearsay, as the officers received all of that information from Hart and Halloran, who did not testify and who received at least some of it from unnamed others. The Commonwealth agrees that ""the admitted statements went beyond what was necessary to show the state of police knowledge."" See Commonwealth v. Rosario,
, 507-512 (1999). Under those circumstances, admission of the testimony violated the defendant's right to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment to the United States
Page 352
Constitution. See Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004). The error was not harmless, as the testimony bore on issues central to the Commonwealth's case and central to the defense.

Discussion of the standard of review applicable to the allowance of a motion for a required finding of not guilty pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 25(b)(2). [409-410]
At the trial of indictments charging various drug offenses, the evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant constructively possessed the cocaine found in her apartment, where the defendant's awareness of the cocaine could be inferred from its being found on a table right in front of her, and where the defendant's ability and intent to exercise dominion and control over the cocaine could be inferred from evidence establishing that the defendant was the primary occupant of the apartment and the lack of evidence that anyone other than the defendant controlled the apartment or the contraband and its proceeds [410-413]; further, the evidence was sufficient to permit the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had the requisite intent to distribute the cocaine [413-414].
A Superior Court judge properly denied the criminal defendant's motion to dismiss an indictment on the ground that improper evidence was presented to the grand jury, where alleged prior bad acts testimony was limited and was probative of the defendant's intent to distribute cocaine, and where the defendant did not show that the testimony was either false or misleading. [414]
A Superior Court judge properly denied the criminal defendant's pretrial motion to suppress evidence discovered pursuant to a search warrant, where the affidavit supporting the application for the warrant sufficiently identified the apartment to be searched. [414-415]
At a criminal trial, the judge did not abuse her discretion in declining to entertain, in the middle of a trial, an objection based on the ""knock and announce"" rule as a motion to suppress; further, entry by police five or ten seconds after announcing their presence was permissible where, in the circumstances of the case, it was reasonable for police officers to fear a threat to their safety. [415-416]
At a criminal trial, no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice arose from the admission in evidence of testimony from a police officer testifying as an expert for the Commonwealth, where the officer's statements were not beyond his experience and expertise, and where the testimony was relevant to the question of the defendant's intent to distribute cocaine; further, the witness did not improperly vouch for his own credibility.

. A judge of the Superior Court set aside jury verdicts on various drug offenses as well as a subsequent offender finding, concluding that there was insufficient evidence that the defendant constructively possessed the cocaine found in her apartment. On the Commonwealth's appeal, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to establish constructive possession. None of the other issues raised by the defendant in her cross appeal warrants disturbing the jury verdicts and finding. We therefore reverse the judge's order and reinstate the jury verdicts, the subsequent offender finding, and the judgments.
1. Background. On February 1, 2008, the defendant was indicted for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, second or subsequent offense, in violation of G. L. c. 94C, § 32A(c) and (d), and for doing so in a school zone, in violation of G. L. c. 94C, § 32J. She made a motion to suppress evidence, not currently before this court, which was denied. After obtaining new counsel, she moved to dismiss the indictment based on purportedly prejudicial evidence presented to the grand jury, and moved to suppress evidence for violation of the search warrant particularity requirement. Both motions were denied. After the jury returned guilty verdicts,
the defendant renewed her motion for a required finding of not guilty pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P.
Page 408
25(b)(2),  378 Mass. 896  (1979), and the trial judge allowed the motion and ordered the entry of not guilty findings, relying chiefly on Commonwealth v. Boria,
(2003) (Boria), and Commonwealth v. Brown,
(1993) (Brown). The Commonwealth appealed pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 25(c)(1), and the defendant cross-appealed.
We summarize the evidence at trial in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. See Commonwealth v. Escalera,
, 649 (2012), citing Commonwealth v. Latimore,
, 677 (1979). On December 11, 2007, at approximately 10:00 P.M., officers from the Brockton police department and the State police executed a search warrant for an apartment on the third floor of 109 Green Street in Brockton. The officers knocked and announced themselves, and after five or ten seconds State Trooper Erik Telford forced the door open with a battering ram. Inside, the officers found the defendant on the living room couch and her codefendant, David Nelson,
also near the couch. The defendant was wearing only a T-shirt and underwear at the time; Nelson did not have a shirt on. The defendant requested clothing, and an officer brought her clothing from the bedroom. Both defendants were secured outside the apartment during the search.
The apartment was very small, consisting of a living room with a closet and kitchenette, a small hallway, one small bedroom, and a bathroom. The living room were approximately eight feet by twelve feet. In the living room were a couch, a coffee table about three feet long, a chair, an end table, and a television. The bedroom was smaller than the living room and contained a bed, a dresser, and plastic shelving. The apartment was cluttered, with trash and clothing, and in disarray.
Brockton police Detective Robert Diliddo found and seized two cellular telephones (phones) and a digital scale on the coffee table.
The scale is small and resembles a compact disk (CD) when closed, as it was when Diliddo found it. One of the phones contained a photograph of Nelson. Subsequently, Brockton police Lieutenant (then Sergeant) Kevin O'Connell discovered
Page 409
on the coffee table seven individually wrapped pieces of what he believed to be ""crack"" cocaine. This substance later tested positive for cocaine and weighed approximately 3.3 grams. There was testimony that the smaller pieces of crack cocaine would sell for twenty dollars, and the largest for as much as fifty or eighty dollars.
Officers also seized $110 in cash, in smaller denomination bills, from the bedroom; a box of Glad plastic bags from the end table in the living room; and a BB gun from the living room closet. Telford observed women's clothing, women's perfume, and women's lotions in the bedroom, but did not observe any men's clothing there. At booking, both the defendant and Nelson gave 109 Green Street, apartment 3, as their address.

Brockton police Detective Thomas Keating testified as an expert for the Commonwealth, over the defendant's objection. He testified that crack cocaine is frequently packaged in sandwich bags. Keating also testified that money found along with crack cocaine is indicative of drug distribution and may be the proceeds from drug sales. He found the discovery of a scale significant, stating, ""I never saw an addict buy crack cocaine and weigh it unless they're buying it to sell it.""
Neither codefendant testified. The defendant's counsel argued chiefly that the drugs were not hers; Nelson's defense was personal use.
2. Commonwealth's appeal. a. Standard of review. The defendant asserts that we should defer to the trial judge's ruling and review the trial judge's allowance of the rule 25(b)(2) motion for abuse of discretion, citing Commonwealth v. Cobb,
, 192 (1987), and Commonwealth v. Woodward,
, 668 (1998). She misunderstands the context of Cobb and Woodward.
A rule 25(b)(2) motion may seek any or all of three forms of relief: a new trial, a finding of not guilty, or a reduction of the verdict to a lesser included offense. See Commonwealth v. Keough,
, 317-318 (1982).
The standard for a
Page 410
new trial is akin to that under Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(b), as appearing in  435 Mass. 1501  (2001). ""A judge has similar broad discretion to grant a new trial in the interests of justice under both rules."" Commonwealth v. Pring-Wilson,
, 732 n.14 (2007). Likewise, a judge asked to reduce a verdict has the discretion to consider the weight of the evidence to reach the result the judge believes most consonant with justice. See Commonwealth v. Almeida,
, 613-614 (2008), and cases cited. Both of these forms of relief are discretionary, and we would review for abuse of discretion, with particular deference to the trial judge's familiarity with the proceedings and credibility judgments. See Commonwealth v. Preston,
, 324 (1984); Commonwealth v. Cornish,
, 177 (1989); Commonwealth v. Peppicelli,
, 93 (2007).
However, a motion seeking a finding of not guilty due to insufficient evidence stands on different footing. The sufficiency of the evidence is a question of law because the judge must take the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth rather than weighing it independently. See Commonwealth v. Torres,
, 321-324 (1987); Commonwealth v. Walker,
, 197-198 (2007). See also Smith, Criminal Practice & Procedure § 36.21 (3d ed. 2007). Therefore, ""the judge does not properly exercise discretion concerning the weight or integrity of the evidence, but instead must assess the legal sufficiency of the evidence by the standard set out in Commonwealth v. Latimore, 378 Mass. [at] 677."" Commonwealth v. Doucette,
, 456 (1990). We thus determine the legal question of sufficiency without deference to the trial judge's ruling. See ibid.
b. Sufficiency of the evidence. As the cocaine was not found on the defendant's person, she was tried on a theory of constructive possession.
The Commonwealth therefore was required to
Page 411
prove the defendant's knowledge of the cocaine, and her ability and intent to exercise dominion and control over it. See Boria, 440 Mass at 418; Commonwealth v. Gonzalez,
, 146 (2008). ""Proof of possession of a controlled substance may be established by circumstantial evidence, and the inferences that can be drawn therefrom."" Commonwealth v. Brzezinski,
, 409 (1989), quoting from Commonwealth v. LaPerle,
, 426 (1985). However, mere presence in proximity to contraband, or even ""[l]iving in a place where drugs are in plain view and being sold,"" is insufficient to establish constructive possession. Boria, 440 Mass. at 418. See Commonwealth v. Charlton,
, 300 (2012) (""That a defendant provides as [her] address the place where contraband is found does not alone provide an ability and intent to control the contraband""). Rather, ""[o]ther incriminating evidence"" is necessary to ""tip the scale in favor of sufficiency."" Commonwealth v. Brzezinski, supra at 410, quoting from Commonwealth v. Albano,
, 134 (1977). A ""particular link"" of the defendant to the contraband, or at least to the area where the contraband is found, must be established. Boria, 440 Mass. at 420. See Commonwealth v. Rarick,
, 913 (1986) (drugs and paraphernalia found in bedroom with defendant's belongings); Commonwealth v. Clarke,
, 505-506 (1998) (defendant's clothes and documents found in bedroom with contraband).
In this case, the jury could reasonably infer the defendant's awareness of the cocaine and ability and intent to exercise dominion and control over it. In the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence supported an inference of the defendant's awareness of the cocaine. The cocaine was found on a table right in front of her. Although the table was cluttered, the cocaine was not concealed. See Boria, 440 Mass. at 417, 421 (presence where contraband was found permitted reasonable
Page 412
inference of awareness even where drugs were hidden); Commonwealth v. Montalvo,
, 323-326 (2010). The apartment was also very small. See Commonwealth v. Pratt,
, 651- 652 (1990) (drugs and paraphernalia in plain view in one-room cottage). Contrast Boria, 440 Mass. at 420 n.5 (no evidence of size or layout of apartment). As explained more fully below, the defendant was also a resident and not merely present in the apartment. See Commonwealth v. Charlton, 81 Mass. App. Ct. at 302-303, quoting from Commonwealth v. Handy,
, 781 n.5 (1991) (""A defendant's 'residential status at a premises is a relevant inculpatory factor to be considered . . . , since it indicates ""more than mere presence""' "").
The more difficult issue, then, is whether there was sufficient evidence of the defendant's ability and intent to exercise dominion and control over the cocaine. As stated earlier, the cocaine was located on the table in front of her when officers entered the apartment. We also consider it significant that the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, is sufficient to establish that the defendant was the primary occupant of the apartment. See Brown, 34 Mass. App. Ct. at 225, 227 (""there was obviously sufficient evidence"" to convict codefendant Howard of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute because ""[t]he apartment was Howard's place; it was full of his personal papers,"" and he was ""the person who controlled the apartment""). Cf. Commonwealth v. Charlton, supra at 303. The defendant here gave the apartment as her address at booking. See id. at 302-303. She was there at a late hour of the night in a state of undress. See Commonwealth v. Rodriquez,
, 945-946 (1983). Cf. Commonwealth v. Arias,
, 615, 619 (1990), S.C.,
(1991). The sole bedroom contained only women's items, and the police retrieved clothing for her from it, giving rise to a reasonable inference that it was hers. See Commonwealth v. Rarick, 23 Mass. App. Ct. at 913; Commonwealth v. Clarke, 44 Mass. App. Ct. at 505-506.
Finally, there was no evidence establishing that another person in the apartment, rather than the defendant, was the person
Page 413
controlling the apartment or the contraband and its proceeds.
In contrast, in Boria and especially in Brown, the evidence strongly pointed to other codefendants as responsible for the drugs.
In Brown, one codefendant (Howard) was the primary occupant and another (Mikell) was found with cash and cocaine on her person, apparently attempting to dispose of other drugs. Brown, 34 Mass. App. Ct. at 225. In Boria, one of the codefendants had over $1,200 in cash on him. Boria, 440 Mass. at 417 n.3.
The only cash found here was the $110 located in the bedroom belonging to the defendant. See Commonwealth v. Rarick, 23 Mass. App. Ct. at 913. Although this is not an unusually large amount of cash, the jury could have inferred that it constituted the proceeds of drug sales, in light of the expert testimony as well as other evidence concerning the value of the seized drugs. See Commonwealth v. Arias, 29 Mass. App. Ct. at 619 n.10. In sum, the evidence here sufficed to establish knowledge as well as ability and intent to exercise dominion and control over the cocaine. See Commonwealth v. Alcantara,
, 596-597 (2002).
As for intent to distribute, there was sufficient evidence based on the quantity of the cocaine; the expert testimony regarding the differences between distributors and users of cocaine; and the presence of plastic bags, a cellular phone, a BB gun, and
Page 414
most particularly, a digital scale. We therefore reverse the order entering findings of not guilty.
3. Defendant's cross appeal. The defendant raises several issues that she urges are grounds to reverse her convictions if the evidence was sufficient to sustain them. We take them in turn.
a. Motion to dismiss. The defendant moved to dismiss the indictment on the basis that improper evidence was presented to the grand jury. See generally Commonwealth v. O'Dell,
(1984). Specifically, Diliddo testified at the grand jury that the police were investigating drug sales at 109 Green Street, apartment 3, and that Telford had a confidential informant who knew that the defendant and Nelson were selling drugs at that apartment. The defendant contends that this information constituted prior bad acts and that it was irrelevant because she was not charged with distribution of drugs, only possession with intent to distribute. See Commonwealth v. Vinnie,
, 174-175, cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1007 (1998). However, this limited testimony was probative of the defendant's intent to distribute, and the defendant has not shown that it was either false or misleading. See Commonwealth v. Brien,
, 914 (1984); Commonwealth v. Sullivan, 82 Mass. App. Ct. 293 , 299 (2012). Cf. Commonwealth v. Helfant,
, 224-225 (1986). Seeking an indictment for possession with intent to distribute rather than distribution was within ""the discretion of the prosecuting authority to decide what charge the government will bring."" Commonwealth v. Rose,
, 919 (2002). Cf. Commonwealth v. Gordon,
, 500-501 (1991). The motion to dismiss was properly denied.
b. Motion to suppress. The defendant argues that her motion to suppress based on the warrant particularity requirement should have been allowed. See generally Commonwealth v. Balicki,
, 7-8 (2002); G. L. c. 276, § 2. When he applied for the search warrant, Diliddo believed that there were three apartments at 109 Green Street, and therefore sought and secured a warrant for ""109 Green St, Brockton Ma, third floor apartment."" In fact, there were nine apartments in that building, three on each floor. The warrant could therefore have been read as permitting a search of any of three apartments.
Page 415
However, Diliddo's affidavit supporting the warrant included information by an informant that the third-floor apartment was accessed via the side door adjacent to the fire escape, and was at the top of the stairs, ""right in front of you with a yellow sign on the front door that reads something to the effect of 'Private/Keep Out.' "" The officers executing the warrant found the defendant's apartment as described, and entered and searched the correct apartment. The case is analogous to Commonwealth v. Todisco,
(1973), where a warrant could have referred to any of three apartments in a building, but the affidavit sufficiently identified the apartment to be searched. Id. at 448-450. There, as here, the affiant was involved in the execution of the warrant and located the defendant's apartment and no other. See id. at 449. Under the circumstances, we discern no error in the denial of the motion to suppress. See Commonwealth v. Toledo,
, 696- 697 (2006).

c. ""Knock and announce"" rule. After Telford testified at trial that he had waited five or ten seconds between announcing his presence and forcing the door open, the defendant made an objection based on the ""knock and announce"" rule, and now argues that suppression of the fruits of the search was warranted on this basis. See generally Commonwealth v. Santiago,
, 574-575 (2008). The defendant did not file a timely motion to suppress, and indeed never filed a motion to suppress on this basis. See Mass.R.Crim.P. 13(a), (d), as appearing in  442 Mass. 1517  (2004). She requested no specific relief from the trial judge.
Even treating the objection as a motion to suppress, it was within the judge's discretion to decline to entertain it in the middle of trial. See Commonwealth v. Pope,
, 507 (1983). See also Smith, Criminal Practice & Procedure § 24.23, at 359. Moreover, we have upheld a
Page 416
five-second delay for a narcotics search warrant where the police have information that occupants may have guns. See Commonwealth v. Bush,
, 132-135 & n.8 (2008). Here, an informant had told Telford that, within a day prior to the search, Nelson had loaded a firearm and threatened to make someone ""disappear,"" and probation records indicated that Nelson had been convicted of two prior weapons offenses.
In light of this information and prior controlled purchases indicating drug distribution, ""it was reasonable for the police to fear a threat to their safety within five seconds."" Id. at 135.
d. Expert testimony. Finally, the defendant argues that the trial judge erred in permitting Keating to testify beyond his expertise and vouch for his own credibility. The defendant filed a motion in limine to prevent Keating from testifying ""that a theoretical drug 'buyer' would not purchase multiple bags of cocaine and instead purchase said substances in bulk,"" relying on Commonwealth v. Little,
(2009), which criticized an ""imprecise economic argument"" made by Keating as ""likely beyond his expertise as a narcotics investigator."" Id. at 771. The trial judge allowed the motion to the extent that Keating's testimony related to the behavior of hypothetical buyers rather than his own experiences and observations, but indicated she could not completely address the issue in the abstract. However, although the defendant objected to Keating's qualification as an expert (which she does not contest on appeal), she did not object to any of the specific statements that she now challenges, and so we review Keating's testimony for error creating a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See id. at 770.
Keating testified that crack addicts usually do not keep money on their persons because they would spend it on more cocaine, and so the recovery of money suggests that it could be the proceeds from drug sales. He also testified that addicts would likely have drug paraphernalia around because they would consume the cocaine as soon as they got it, and he had never seen an addict weigh crack cocaine unless they were going to sell part of it. These statements were not objected to, and are
Page 417
not obviously beyond Keating's experience and expertise.
See id. at 770-771. To the extent Keating made ""economic"" arguments of the type at issue in Little, they were largely elicited in response to defense counsel's questions about the behavior of a hypothetical crack addict and were not objected to.
See Commonwealth v. DeCastro,
, 938 (1987). This evidence was also primarily relevant to the question of intent to distribute, whereas the defendant's defense was lack of possession. Cf. Commonwealth v. Springer,
, 480 (2000). There was no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice from this testimony.
Finally, the defendant calls attention to a portion of Keating's testimony where he described how prosecutors seek his opinion whether he would be prepared to take the stand to testify whether the drugs were for distribution or personal use, and that he would give them his opinion. Keating stated that if he opines that personal use is more likely, the prosecutor typically does not proceed with charges based on intent to distribute. He further indicated that he has only testified that a situation is not indicative of distribution five to ten times out of hundreds of times testifying as an expert in court. The defendant asserts that by this testimony, Keating was improperly vouching for his own credibility. Cf. Commonwealth v. Burgess,
, 436 (2008), quoting from Simon v. Solomon,
, 105 (1982). Although generally not an appropriate line of inquiry, in this instant case it was a fair response to Nelson's pointed attack on Keating's credibility as ""the ultimate hired gun"" trying to help out his colleagues, which Nelson's counsel made during
Page 418
his opening and reinforced during his cross-examination. Cf. Commonwealth v. Ortega,
, 180 n.17 (2004); Commonwealth v. Saunders,
, 509 (2009). In his opening, for example, defense counsel for Nelson stated that Keating has a ""percentage . . . that . . . [Dustin] Pedroia and the Red Sox would die for. Almost a thousand percent saying things are consistent with distribution."" The defendant did not object to Nelson's cross-examination, which elicited the same information. We discern no abuse of discretion under these circumstances in admitting this testimony.
4. Conclusion. There was sufficient evidence to support the defendant's convictions, and no error requiring reversal of the judgments. The order allowing the defendant's motion to set aside the verdicts and finding is reversed. The jury verdicts, the judge's subsequent offender finding, and the judgments shall be reinstated.
So ordered.",,
 COMMONWEALTH  vs.  GIOVANNIE LUNA.,"Controlled Substances.  Firearms.  Practice, Criminal, Motion to suppress.  Probable Cause.  Search and Seizure, Probable cause, Motor vehicle, Inevitable discovery.  Constitutional Law, Probable cause, Search and seizure.
A Superior Court judge did not err in granting so much of a criminal defendant's pretrial motion to suppress evidence as sought to exclude heroin found on his person following the traffic stop of a motor vehicle driven by the defendant, where the information received by police from a confidential informant, corroborated by police investigation and the defendant's attempts to evade surveillance, established probable cause that the defendant was committing a drug offense and permitted the police to search the defendant's person incident to his lawful arrest [526-528]; however, where the police exceeded their territorial jurisdiction in the execution of a warrantless search of a second vehicle in a neighboring town, and where it could not be said that the discovery of the evidence contained in that vehicle was certain as a practical matter, this court reversed so much of the judge's order as denied the motion to suppress such evidence [528-530].","
The defendant has been charged with various narcotics and firearm offenses.  Following an evidentiary hearing, a Superior Court judge denied, in large part, the defendant's motion to suppress evidence.  The defendant's application to pursue an interlocutory appeal was allowed by a single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court, who reported the matter to this court.
Page 524
On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) the judge erred in concluding that the Springfield police officers had reasonable suspicion to stop the defendant's vehicle and to pat frisk him, (2) the subsequent warrantless search and seizure of heroin and a firearm from a second motor vehicle was not supported by probable cause or any exception to the warrant requirement, and (3) the police officers lacked authority to conduct the second search outside the city of Springfield.  Because we conclude that the Springfield police exceeded their territorial jurisdiction in the execution of the second vehicle search, we reverse so much of the order as denied the motion to suppress evidence seized during that search.
Background.  We summarize the pertinent facts from the judge's findings on the motion to suppress, supplemented where appropriate by uncontroverted suppression hearing testimony that the judge explicitly or implicitly credited.  See Commonwealth v. Jones-Pannell,
, 431 (2015).  In April of 2015, Springfield police Officer Jaime Bruno, a narcotics investigator with fifteen years' experience, was told by a confidential informant that on April 15, 2015, an individual named ""Gio,"" later identified as the defendant, would make a large delivery of heroin at the intersection of Liberty Street and Denton Circle in East Springfield at about noon that day.  According to the informant, Gio would be driving a black Mini Cooper automobile, and the informant provided the license plate number.  The informant, with whom Officer Bruno had been in ""constant communication"" for the preceding seven to eight months, had previously provided information to Officer Bruno that resulted in numerous seizures and arrests.  The informant told Officer Bruno that he
had purchased heroin from Gio at that same intersection on several occasions, and also within the last seventy-two hours at Gio's residence at the Toll House Apartments in West Springfield.  Other officers confirmed that the defendant lived at the Toll House Apartments, and informed Officer Bruno that the defendant also had a residence at 122 Beauregard Terrace in Chicopee.
The Springfield police had previously received complaints that nonresidents of the area were congregating at the intersection of Liberty Street and Denton Circle.  On the morning of April 15, 2015, Officer Bruno went to that location to see for himself.  He
Page 525
observed two individuals standing at the intersection whom he had previously arrested for heroin offenses.
Later that morning, at approximately 10:00 a.m., surveillance officers observed the defendant and a Hispanic male leave the Toll House Apartments, place two large plastic containers in the back seat of the Mini Cooper, and drive it to 122 Beauregard Terrace in Chicopee.  There, the defendant approached a red Honda automobile parked at the end of the driveway, opened the trunk with a key, and retrieved a black plastic bag the size of a softball.  He then reentered the Mini Cooper and drove in the direction of East Springfield.
The police followed in unmarked vehicles.  When the Mini Cooper was within approximately two miles of the intersection of Liberty Street and Denton Circle, the defendant began driving in an erratic manner.  He drove up and down a number of side streets with no apparent destination, suddenly stopping and then accelerating beyond the speed limit.  This unusual driving caused Officer Bruno, based on his training and experience, to conclude that the defendant was attempting to determine if he was being followed.
The police stopped the Mini Cooper.  Officer Bruno removed the defendant and conducted a patfrisk for weapons.  He felt a large bulge in the defendant's pocket, which he recognized, based on his experience and the size and texture of the objects, as packets of heroin.  He then removed a black bag from the defendant's pocket, which appeared to be the one he had observed the defendant remove from the trunk of the red Honda.  Officer Bruno also removed a set of Honda car keys and three cellular telephones from the defendant's person.
The defendant was arrested.  The defendant pleaded with Officer Bruno for permission to telephone his girl friend; Officer Bruno declined.  Within minutes of the arrest, all three cellular telephones seized from the defendant began to ring and the unanswered calls continued for approximately ten minutes.  Concerned the delay in the defendant's arrival had alerted those waiting for the delivery of heroin to a potential problem such that the investigation had been compromised, Officer Bruno and other officers returned to 122 Beauregard Terrace in Chicopee, arriving within ten to fifteen minutes of the defendant's arrest.  When, after five minutes, no one responded to Officer Bruno's announcement of police presence and knocks on two different doors, officers entered the Honda using the keys obtained from the defendant.  Several bricks of heroin and a firearm were seized from the trunk.
Page 526
Prior to the vehicle search, Officer Bruno had requested that Chicopee police officers provide a ""'uniformed' police presence at the scene given that the Springfield police officers were in plain clothes in unmarked vehicles and they might not be recognized as law enforcement.""  Chicopee police officers did not arrive until after the search of the Honda.
Discussion.  We review the judge's decision under familiar standards.  We accept the judge's factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.  See Commonwealth v. Meneus,
, 234 (2017).  However, we ""make an independent determination of the correctness of the judge's application of constitutional principles to the facts as found.""  Commonwealth v. Durand,
, 664 (2016), cert. denied, 86 U.S.L.W. 3156 (2017), quoting from Commonwealth v. Bostock,
, 619 (2008).
1.  The vehicle stop and arrest in Springfield.  The defendant claims that the heroin found in his pocket should have been suppressed because the stop of the Mini Cooper was not supported by reasonable suspicion.  We disagree.  A stop is justified when police have a reasonable suspicion that the person stopped is committing, has committed, or is about to commit a crime.  Commonwealth v. Silva,
, 405 (1974).  The reasonable suspicion must be based on ""specific and articulable facts and the specific reasonable inferences which follow from such facts in light of the officer's experience.""  Id. at 406.  When the stop is based on an unnamed informant's tip, as in this case, ""art. 14 requires that the information satisfy the two-pronged standard set forth in Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108 (1964), and Spinelli v. United States, 393 U.S. 410 (1969).""  Commonwealth v. Welch,
, 650 (1995).   The Commonwealth must demonstrate the veracity of the informant and his basis of knowledge.  Ibid.  ""Independent police corroboration may make up for deficiencies in one or both of these factors.""  Commonwealth v. Mubdi,
, 396 (2010) (quotation omitted).
An informant's veracity may be shown by ""underlying circumstances from which . . . the law enforcement officials could have concluded the informant was credible or reliable.""  Commonwealth v. Escalera,
, 645 n.8 (2012), quoting from Commonwealth v. Cast,
, 896 (1990).  Here, the informant had a proven track record.  He had provided information to Officer Bruno on more than fifty prior occasions in the preceding seven to eight months.  The information provided by
Page 527
the informant led to ""well over fifteen"" seizures of drugs, resulting in multiple convictions.  We agree with the judge's conclusion that this evidence sufficiently established the informant's veracity.  See Commonwealth v. Robinson,
, 165 (1988) (""The informant's past record of supplying credible information satisfies the reliability prong"").
As to the second prong of the Aguilar-Spinelli standard, a prior purchase of drugs by an informant can satisfy the basis of knowledge test.  Commonwealth v. Montanez,
, 299-300 (1991).  See Commonwealth v. Ilges,
, 508 (2005).  Here, the informant reported that he had purchased heroin on several occasions from the defendant, whom he knew by name, both at the intersection of Liberty Street and Denton Circle, and also at the defendant's residence, which he identified by address.  Moreover, it was reasonable to infer from the informant's detailed information that he had direct personal knowledge of the defendant's heroin distribution.  See Commonwealth v. Mendes,
, 365 (2012) (level of detail in informant's description consistent with firsthand knowledge).  He described a transaction that was to occur at a specific intersection at a definite time and reported the make, color, and license plate number of the vehicle the defendant would be driving.  Independent police investigation confirmed that the defendant lived at the address provided by the informant, and had a second address in Chicopee.  Police also confirmed that the Mini Cooper described by the informant was registered to the defendant's girl friend.
The information provided by the informant was further corroborated when, approximately one hour before the drug transaction was to occur, police observed the defendant leave the Toll House Apartments in the Mini Cooper, drive to his residence at 122 Beauregard Terrace in Chicopee, take a softball-sized black bag from the Honda, and then drive in the direction of the transaction predicted by the informant.  While following the defendant, the police reasonably concluded that he was engaged in counter surveillance as he drove evasively through a residential neighborhood.  In these circumstances, the judge correctly concluded that the police had more than reasonable suspicion to stop the defendant -- they had probable cause to arrest him.
""[P]robable cause exists where, at the moment of arrest, the facts and circumstances within the knowledge of the police are enough to warrant a prudent person in believing that the individual arrested has committed or was committing an offense.""
Page 528
Commonwealth v. Charley,
, 228 (2017), quoting from Commonwealth v. Storey,
, 321 (1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 955 (1980).  We consider the entire ""silent movie"" in a practical and nontechnical way, through the eyes of an experienced narcotics investigator.  Commonwealth v. Santaliz,
, 242 (1992).  Applying these principles, we conclude that the information received from the informant, corroborated by police investigation and the defendant's attempts to evade surveillance, established probable cause that he was committing a drug offense.  Because the police had probable cause to arrest the defendant at the time they stopped the Mini Cooper, the search of the defendant's person was permissible incident to that lawful arrest.  See Commonwealth v. Blevines,
, 608 (2003).

2.  Search of the Honda in Chicopee.  The defendant challenges the warrantless search of the Honda in Chicopee on multiple grounds.  Because we agree with the defendant that, in the circumstances presented here, the Springfield police lacked authority to conduct a warrantless vehicle search outside their jurisdiction, we limit our discussion to that issue.

It is well settled that ""[a] police officer lacks authority to act outside his or her jurisdiction, unless specifically authorized by statute or in the performance of a valid citizen's arrest at common law.""  Commonwealth v. Twombly,
, 442 (2001).  The Commonwealth argues that the police had statutory authorization here.  Specifically, the Commonwealth cites G. L. c. 276, § 2A, for the proposition that searches can be broadly executed by any State, county, or local law enforcement officer.
While it is true that G. L. c. 276, § 2A, implicitly authorizes any Massachusetts law enforcement officer to execute search warrants anywhere
Page 529
in the Commonwealth, the clear language of the statute applies only to searches executed pursuant to a warrant.  It does not apply to warrantless searches like the one in this case.  The Commonwealth cites no authority, and we have found none, permitting a warrantless search by a Massachusetts police officer acting outside his territorial jurisdiction.
Here, it is undisputed that the warrantless search of the Honda was conducted by the Springfield police in the city of Chicopee, outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Springfield police department.  Although the Chicopee police were called for assistance, they were not involved in the investigation and were not present at the time the search was conducted.  Thus, the Springfield police acted outside their authority, and the contraband seized from the Honda in Chicopee should have been suppressed.  See Commonwealth v. Lahey,
, 610 (2011) (""The appropriate remedy for unauthorized extraterritorial action is suppression of the resulting evidence"").
For the first time on appeal, the Commonwealth argues that even if the police exceeded their territorial authority, the exclusionary rule should not apply because the evidence seized from the Honda would have inevitably been discovered.  The Commonwealth's theory of inevitable discovery is that the Chicopee police, upon their arrival, would have conducted a lawful search of the Honda within their territorial jurisdiction.  We are not persuaded.
""[T]he Commonwealth has the burden of proving the facts bearing on inevitability by a preponderance of the evidence.""  Commonwealth v. Ubilez,
, 817-818 (2016), quoting from Commonwealth v. Perrot,
, 547 (1990).  ""The motion judge's findings [on inevitable discovery] should be specific and detailed.""  Lahey, supra at 613.  ""Once the relevant facts are found by a preponderance of the evidence, the question is whether on those facts discovery by lawful means was certain as a practical matter.""  Commonwealth v. O'Connor,
, 117 (1989).  ""The test of inevitability should be made on the circumstances existing at the time of the unlawful seizure.""  Id. at 117 n.4.
Even assuming there was a lawful basis to search the Honda without a warrant,
a question we do not reach, we cannot conclude that a lawful search by the Chicopee police was ""virtually
Page 530
certain.""  Perrot, supra.  Indeed, at the time the search was conducted by the Springfield police, even the arrival of the Chicopee police, although anticipated, was not certain.  Moreover, because the theory of inevitable discovery was not advanced at the suppression hearing, the Commonwealth did not elicit testimony to support it, and the judge's comprehensive memorandum of decision included no findings related to inevitable discovery.  Accordingly, on the record before us, we cannot conclude that ""discovery by lawful means was certain as a practical matter.""  O'Connor, supra.
Conclusion.  So much of the order as denied the defendant's motion to suppress evidence seized from the Honda in Chicopee is reversed.  In all other respects, the order is affirmed.

A Superior Court judge erred in allowing the criminal defendant's pretrial motion to suppress evidence gathered from his apartment pursuant to a search warrant, where, for purposes of establishing probable cause for the issuance of the warrant, a single controlled buy of cocaine, although imperfectly executed (i.e., the police did not observe the confidential police informant's entry into and exit from the defendant's apartment building), nevertheless sufficiently corroborated the information provided by the first-time confidential informant. [480-485]","
In this interlocutory appeal by the Commonwealth, we must decide whether the information provided by a first-time, confidential police informant (CI) was sufficiently corroborated by a single, imperfectly executed controlled ""buy"" of cocaine for the purposes of establishing probable cause for the issuance of a warrant to search the defendant's apartment.  We conclude that the affidavit was sufficient to establish the CI's basis of knowledge and veracity, and that the information provided by the CI, along
Page 479
with information gathered by the police, as set forth in the affidavit in support of the search warrant, established probable cause.  Accordingly, we reverse the order allowing the defendant's motion to suppress.
Background.  The affidavit filed as part of the warrant application contained the following facts.
In November, 2015, Detective Gracia of the New Bedford police department spoke with the CI, whose identity and whereabouts were known to the police.
The CI stated that they had contacted the defendant, Paulo Monteiro, by telephone or had ""show[n] up [at] his residence"" in New Bedford to purchase cocaine in the past.  The CI informed Detective Gracia that they continue to purchase cocaine from the defendant.  The CI provided Detective Gracia with a physical description of the seller (""a Cape Verdean male 20 years old approx 6' tall with a medium build"") and the seller's address.  Detective Gracia confirmed via the police department's computer system that a person named Paulo Monteiro had the same listed address as that provided by the CI.  Detective Gracia also reviewed the defendant's criminal record and determined that he was on probation for statutory rape.  A booking photograph of the defendant was shown to the CI.  The CI stated that the person in the photograph, whom the CI identified as the defendant, was the person who had sold cocaine to the CI in the past.
Detective Gracia later met the CI to arrange a controlled buy of cocaine from the defendant.  The CI was searched and determined to be free of contraband and money.  Detective Gracia then gave the CI money to purchase cocaine from the defendant.  Detective Gracia and other members of the New Bedford police department maintained surveillance of the CI.  They observed the CI walking toward the rear exterior door of the defendant's apartment building.
A short time later, the CI was seen leaving the walkway leading to the rear exterior door.  The defendant was not observed entering or exiting the apartment building through the rear exterior
Page 480
door.  The CI was kept under surveillance until the CI met Detective Gracia at a predetermined location where the CI provided Detective Gracia with a quantity of what the CI said was cocaine.  The CI stated that they purchased the cocaine from the defendant inside his first-floor apartment.  The CI was again searched and determined to be free of money and contraband.  The material the CI turned over to the police was field tested and found to be cocaine.
Detective Gracia applied for, and a magistrate subsequently issued, a warrant to search the defendant's apartment.  Upon execution of the search warrant, the police found narcotics and drug paraphernalia inside the defendant's apartment.  An indictment was returned against the defendant for trafficking in cocaine.  See G. L. c. 94C, § 32E(b).  The defendant moved to suppress the contraband and related drug paraphernalia found during the search on the basis that the affidavit provided to the magistrate did not establish probable cause.  The defendant's motion to suppress was allowed after the motion judge concluded that the affidavit failed to establish both the CI's basis of knowledge and veracity.  For the reasons set forth below, we reverse.
Discussion.  Article 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights requires that a search warrant issue only upon a showing of probable cause.  Commonwealth v. Foster,
, 241 (2015).  In determining whether the probable cause standard was met, our inquiry ""begins and ends with the 'four corners of the affidavit'"" supporting the application for the search warrant.  Commonwealth v. O'Day,
, 297 (2003), quoting from Commonwealth v. Villella,
, 428 (1995). ""Because a determination of probable cause is a conclusion of law, we review a search warrant affidavit de novo.""  Foster, supra at 242.
In Commonwealth v. Upton,
, 373 (1985) (Upton II), the Supreme Judicial Court determined that ""art. 14 provides more substantive protection to criminal defendants than does the Fourth Amendment"" to the United States Constitution.  When an affidavit in support of a search warrant is based on information supplied by an unknown informant, art. 14 requires the magistrate called upon to issue a search warrant to apply the so-called Aguilar-Spinelli test to assess whether the affidavit is sufficient to establish probable cause to issue the warrant.  See Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108 (1964); Spinelli v. United States,
Page 481
393 U.S. 410 (1969).

""Where information from an unidentified informant is relied on to supply probable cause to search, art. 14 . . . requires that the affidavit apprise the magistrate of (1) some of the underlying circumstances from which the informant concluded that contraband was where he claimed it was (the basis of knowledge test), and (2) some of the underlying circumstances from which the affiant concluded that the informant was credible or the information reliable (the veracity test).""
Commonwealth v. Warren,
, 88 (1994).
The defendant concedes, and we agree, that the basis of knowledge test was satisfied by the CI's statement that they had purchased cocaine from the defendant inside the target apartment within seventy-two hours of the warrant issuing.  See Commonwealth v. Desper,
, 166 (1994).
We next examine whether the veracity prong has been satisfied.  The affidavit submitted to the magistrate indicated that the CI was a first-time, confidential police informant, which rendered the statements made by the CI contained in the affidavit, standing alone, insufficient to satisfy the veracity prong of the Aguilar-Spinelli test.  See Commonwealth v. Alfonso A.,
, 376 (2003) (""Although police knowledge of the CI's 'identity' and 'whereabouts' would not be adequate standing alone to confirm the informant's reliability, it is a factor that weighs in
Page 482
favor of reliability""); Commonwealth v. Figueroa,
, 787 (2009) (information from first-time informant ""ordinarily would not meet the veracity requirements imposed by art. 14"").
However, ""a properly monitored controlled purchase of illegal drugs provides sufficient corroborating evidence to overcome any shortfalls in meeting the constitutional reliability requirements imposed on confidential informants.""  Figueroa, supra at 787-788.  See Commonwealth v. Luna,
, 134 (1991) (two controlled purchases of narcotics by confidential informant were sufficient, standing alone, to provide probable cause to search defendant's home); Warren, 418 Mass. at 87, 89 (tip containing detailed information about defendant's apartment and location of drugs contained therein, coupled with single controlled buy, sufficient to establish informant's veracity); Villella, 39 Mass. App. Ct. at 427-428 (probable cause established where police corroborated portions of informant's detailed tip and informant made single controlled buy at defendant's residence through intermediary).  See also Commonwealth v. Cruz,
, 842 n.2 (2000), citing Warren, supra.
In Desper, 419 Mass. at 168, the Supreme Judicial Court set forth the essential components of a controlled buy:
""(1) a police officer meets the informant at a location other than the location where is it suspected that criminal activity is occurring; (2) the officer searches the informant to ensure the informant has no drugs on his person and (usually) furnishes the informant with money to purchase drugs; (3) the officer escorts or follows the informant to the premises where it is alleged illegal activity is occurring and watches the informant enter and leave those premises; and (4) the informant turns over to the officer the substance the informant has purchased from the residents of the premises under surveillance.""
Here, the affidavit does not indicate that the affiant observed the CI's physical entry into, or exit from, the building housing the
Page 483
defendant's apartment during the course of the controlled buy.
The defendant argues that this deficiency in the controlled buy rendered the information provided by the CI unreliable for the purposes of establishing probable cause.
Although ""the steps customary in a controlled buy should be taken"" when a controlled buy is being used to corroborate a statement made by a confidential informant that otherwise would not be sufficient to establish probable cause, id. at 170, probable cause may nevertheless be established where the police fail to comply with one of the four investigatory steps customarily associated with a controlled buy.
See id. at 170-171 (probable cause requirement was met where police failed to search confidential informant for contraband before two controlled buys).  Here, the magistrate was not compelled to conclude that because the police did not observe the CI's physical entry into and exit from the apartment building, the information contained in the affidavit was insufficient to establish probable cause.  In the circumstances of this case, the police observation of the CI walking toward the door to the building and then a few minutes later walking away from that area and turning over a quantity of drugs, when coupled with the other facts, was sufficient to support the magistrate's conclusion that the CI was credible.  In cases involving a controlled buy of drugs from a seller who is located inside a multiunit building, we do not require that the police observe the informant enter the particular apartment where the transaction is reported to have occurred in order to demonstrate the reliability of the informant.  See Warren, 418 Mass. at 90 (""It is not fatal to the warrant application that the police did not observe which of the three apartments the informant entered.  Based on the information provided by the informant and their own observations, the police could infer that the defendant was dealing drugs from his second-floor apartment"").
""In dealing with probable cause . . . we deal with probabilities.  These are not technical; they are factual and practical considerations
Page 484
of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men . . . act.""  Commonwealth v. Hason,
, 174 (1982), quoting from Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 175 (1949).  To that end, ""the question is whether reasonable and prudent people would act on the basis of the information gathered by the police, not whether the information would satisfy legal technicians.""  Commonwealth v. Fontaine,
, 704 (2014), citing Brinegar, supra.  Here, the controlled buy was executed less than seventy-two hours before the filing of the warrant application and affidavit.  The affidavit indicated that the CI, whose identity and whereabouts were known to Detective Gracia, see Alfonso A., 438 Mass. at 375-376, positively identified the defendant as having sold the CI cocaine from the target apartment in the past.  The CI reported that they had been buying cocaine from the defendant at the location to be searched.  The affidavit further stated that the defendant was on probation for committing a serious felony.  The affidavit indicated that all the essential steps of a controlled buy were met, with the exception that the CI was not directly observed entering or exiting the building or target apartment.  While the execution of the controlled buy was lacking in this respect, the affidavit stated that the CI was observed walking toward the rear door of the defendant's apartment building, returned a short time later under police surveillance with a quantity of cocaine from the vicinity of the rear exterior door, and informed the officers that they purchased the cocaine from the defendant inside the apartment.  This information was sufficient to allow the magistrate to reasonably infer that the CI entered and purchased drugs in the defendant's apartment.  See Warren, 418 Mass. at 90; Fontaine, supra at 704, quoting from Commonwealth v. Jimenez,
, 218 (2002) (""In reviewing affidavits in support of search warrants, we allow 'considerable latitude' for the drawing of inferences"").

Page 485
Finally, we are mindful that in order to encourage the police to apply for search warrants, a reviewing court should allow ""a certain leeway or leniency in the after-the-fact review of the sufficiency of applications for warrants.""  Commonwealth v. Corradino,
, 416 (1975).  See United States v. Ventresca, 380 U.S. 102, 109 (1965); Commonwealth v. Cruz,
, 840 (2000); Commonwealth v. Monterosso,
, 770 (1992).
For the above reasons, we conclude that the affidavit, ""taken as a whole and read in a commonsense fashion,"" Alphonso A., 438 Mass. at 375, demonstrated that the CI provided the police with sufficiently reliable information to support the magistrate's probable cause determination.

A Superior Court judge erred in denying a criminal defendant's pretrial motion to suppress evidence (cocaine and other incriminating evidence) found by police while conducting an investigatory search of the defendant's motor vehicle, where the police, who conducted the search in response to their observation of a roll of cash on the inside of the driver's door when the defendant stepped out in response to their exit order, did not have a valid ground (i.e., reasonable suspicion that the defendant had engaged in criminal activity) on which to order the defendant out of the vehicle, given that the police observations of the defendant's brief curbside interaction with an unidentified pedestrian created at most a hunch that a drug transaction had just occurred and, moreover, did not provide sufficient corroboration, beyond purely innocent details, of an informant's tip to establish its reliability for purposes of assessing reasonable suspicion. [341-347] Hanlon, J., dissenting.","
In August, 2014, a grand jury indicted the defendant for trafficking in 200 grams or more of cocaine.  G. L. c. 94C, § 32E (b) (4).  The charge was based on evidence found during a

On the defendant's interlocutory appeal, we reverse.
Standard of review.  ""When reviewing a decision on a motion to suppress, we accept the judge's findings of fact absent clear error, but make an independent determination whether the judge correctly applied constitutional principles to the facts as found.""  Commonwealth v. Evans,
, 688 (2015).  The judge made careful, detailed findings, all of which are supported by the record and therefore are binding on us.  Notably, the judge rejected some of the police witnesses' claims about what they were able to observe from a distance, and the specific factual claims that the judge did credit were qualified.  The factual recitation that follows is drawn from the judge's findings.

Background.  1.  The tip provided to police.  The Boston police focused on the defendant's vehicle because of a tip they had received from an undisclosed source.  Specifically, on or before June 9, 2014, the police received information that a green Volvo station wagon containing a ""large"" amount of drugs would be near a certain intersection in the Roxbury section of Boston.  No other information regarding the tip was provided at the evidentiary hearing.
Thus, for example, there was no evidence that the tipster provided the license plate number of the vehicle, what time it would arrive, or any information whatsoever about the vehicle's occupants, if any.  Similarly, there was no evidence about who the tipster was, how he or she purportedly came into possession of the alleged information, how that information was passed along to police, or whether the police had any reason to trust it.
It was not happenstance that so little evidence was presented about the tip, and none about the tipster.  At the beginning of the evidentiary hearing, the prosecutor made it clear that she did not intend to go into such issues because she did not want to risk
Page 339
identifying the informant.
Thus, in an effort to head off any inquiry into the tip, the prosecutor expressly disavowed trying to establish the tip's reliability pursuant to applicable case law, and she made it clear that she would be ""objecting to any sort of [cross-examination] questions regarding the . . . source of that information that the police had.""  Defense counsel responded that he was content with this arrangement based on his understanding of how the informant's alleged information would be treated.  Specifically, he stated as follows:  ""It's a statement for context only that's not being used because it doesn't satisfy [the standard set forth in Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108 (1964), and Spinelli v. United States, 393 U.S. 410 (1969)].  For those purposes, I've agreed to not go into the -- who the source is, how is it that it came about, what were the exact details of the tip because we're [sic] not using it under Aguilar-Spinelli to suppor[t] the stop or search.""  The judge responded by stating, ""Okay.  Fair enough.""  The prosecutor made no effort to disabuse defense counsel of his understanding.
2.  Police observations.  Upon receiving the tip, four police officers set up surveillance at the intersection mentioned by the informant.  At about 5:15 p.m. on June 9, 2014, they saw a green Volvo station wagon turn at the intersection without the driver using his turn signal.  The vehicle then parked approximately fifty feet away.  Shortly thereafter, one of the officers observed the vehicle's operator, subsequently identified as the defendant, lean down toward his right side ""as if he [were] reaching toward the floor of the passenger side with both hands.""  According to the judge's findings, the officer could not see the defendant's hands or what the defendant might have been doing with them.  Observing from a distance, the officers saw a man approach the parked vehicle from an adjacent building and interact with the defendant at the driver's side window for approximately half a minute.  While the judge found that the police observed the unidentified man who had approached the defendant's vehicle lean toward it ""in a manner consistent with that man placing his hands on the Volvo door or reaching inside the Volvo,"" he also found that the police did not observe the defendant and the unidentified man actually ""reach their hands toward each other, bring their hands
Page 340
together, or exchange any object.""  Furthermore, the judge found that the police did not see anything in the pedestrian's hands as he was walking away from the vehicle, nor did they see him put anything into his pocket, or move his arm in a manner suggesting that he had just put anything there.  Despite the absence of any observation of an item being exchanged between the men, the judge found that their interaction was ""consistent with the two men exchanging something.""
After the man walked away, the defendant drove his vehicle to an adjacent street, where the police pulled his vehicle over.  Although the defendant appeared nervous, he produced his driver's license and vehicle registration when requested to do so.  At this point, there were at least four officers at the scene, and one of them ordered the defendant out of the vehicle.  As the defendant was stepping out of the vehicle, the officer saw a roll of cash in a clear plastic bag on the inside of the driver's door.  After further questioning of the defendant proved fruitless
and a patfrisk of him revealed nothing, the police initiated a thorough search of the vehicle, subsequently aided by a drug-sniffing dog.  They eventually uncovered a metal box underneath the passenger seat, inside of which was a large amount of cocaine and additional cash.
The defendant moved to suppress all the evidence the police collected pursuant to the stop and search of his vehicle, including the cocaine, its packaging, the money (which totaled $11,050), the defendant's cellular telephones, and a magnet that police believed was used to access a ""hide"" inside the vehicle.  The judge ruled in the Commonwealth's favor.  In doing so, he did not rely on the informant's tip in any fashion.  In fact, with regard to that tip, the judge found that ""[t]he Commonwealth did not present any evidence to demonstrate the basis for the informant's knowledge, that the police had any reason to believe that the informant was truthful, or that the police had corroborated the source's information that the [defendant's vehicle] would contain illegal drugs.""  Instead, the judge concluded that the police had reasonable suspicion to stop the vehicle and to order the defendant out of it based on the brief interaction that the police had observed between the defendant and the unidentified man who had approached his vehicle.  Then, according to the judge, once the police observed the wad of bills in the driver's door while the exit
Page 341
order was being executed, they gained probable cause that justified their subsequent search of the vehicle.
Discussion.  1.  Introduction.  The dispute before us is relatively narrow.  It is uncontested that the police found the cocaine and other incriminating evidence during an investigatory search of the defendant's vehicle.  It follows that this search was valid only if the Commonwealth at that point had probable cause to conduct the search.  Commonwealth v. Eggleston,
, 557 (2009).
Moreover, the Commonwealth acknowledges that its claim that it had probable cause depends on the police having observed the roll of bills in the door of the vehicle while they were executing the exit order.  Therefore, if the exit order was not valid, the Commonwealth's claim that it had probable cause to search the vehicle falls short.
While the police could have stopped the vehicle for the civil traffic violation they observed,
this would not have justified the exit order that led to the discovery of the roll of bills.
Rather, in the particular circumstances of this case, the validity of the exit order -- and hence the Commonwealth's claim that it obtained probable cause once it found the wad of bills  -- depends on the police having gained reasonable suspicion that the defendant was engaged in illegal drug activity.  See Commonwealth v. Bostock,
, 621-622 (2008) (exit order justified when police have reasonable suspicion that operator engaged in criminal activity).  The key question, then, is whether, by the time the police ordered the defendant out of his vehicle, they had ""reasonable suspicion, based on specific, articulable facts and reasonable inferences therefrom, that an occupant of the . . . motor vehicle
Page 342
had committed, was committing, or was about to commit a crime.""  Commonwealth v. Anderson,
, 621, cert. denied, 568 U.S. 946 (2012), quoting Commonwealth v. Alvarado,
, 268 (1996).  We turn to that question and begin by examining the grounds on which the judge relied.
2.  Reasonable suspicion.  a.  Police observations.  The motion judge found, without referring to the tip, that the police had reasonable suspicion to believe the defendant was selling illegal drugs based on the defendant's brief interaction with the unidentified pedestrian (after the defendant stopped his vehicle on a public street and reached toward the floor of the vehicle).  We disagree.
As noted, the police did not observe any item being exchanged between the defendant and the person who approached and leaned toward his vehicle.  As the Commonwealth highlights, testimony of an observed hand-to-hand exchange in some circumstances can establish the requisite degree of suspicion that an illegal narcotics sale has occurred even where the police do not ""actually see an object exchanged.""  Commonwealth v. Kennedy,
, 710 (1998).
However, in those narcotics sale cases in which reasonable suspicion has been found in the absence of police observing an item being exchanged, there were significantly more suspicious circumstances than those encountered here.  For example, in Commonwealth v. Stewart,
, 261 (2014), the court found reasonable suspicion for police to stop the defendant where -- knowing that he previously had been arrested for drug dealing -- they observed that ""three persons followed [him] down a narrow street often used by drug users, with [a] woman counting currency as she walked, and then all four huddled briefly together in a doorway, before they dispersed.""  See Commonwealth v. Gomes,
, 511-512 (2009); Commonwealth v. Moses,
, 140 (1990).

Page 343
Here, as a police witness acknowledged, neither the defendant nor the putative buyer was known to the police.
Furthermore, the judge found that the police had no reason, based on past experience, to expect a drug transaction to occur in this particular area, which was made up of ""relatively quiet residential streets.""
All the police observed was an unknown driver stop his vehicle in a residential neighborhood, lean down toward the passenger-side floor, and subsequently have a brief interaction with an unknown pedestrian during which the pedestrian leaned toward the vehicle (as if to place his hands on or in it).  As far as it goes, the judge's finding that what the police saw was ""consistent with"" a hand-to-hand exchange of illegal drugs is unassailable.  However, the defendant's observed actions would also be ""consistent with"" a broad range of other interactions.  These would include, as
Page 344
mere examples, the driver's saying a quick hello to an acquaintance he passed on the street, the driver's asking for directions after looking for a map, or the driver's stopping to drop off tickets to a sporting event or another item to a friend he had arranged to meet.  Even if there were sufficient evidence to establish reasonable suspicion that an exchange had taken place, there was not enough to establish that the exchange was of illegal drugs.  Put otherwise, if the looming presence of the unsubstantiated tip is truly disregarded, then the specific actions that the police observed -- even when seen through the eyes of experienced officers -- created at most a ""hunch"" that a drug transaction had just occurred.  As the Supreme Judicial Court has long held, a ""mere 'hunch' is not enough"" to establish reasonable suspicion.  Commonwealth v. Silva,
, 406 (1974).

The Commonwealth seeks to justify the stop by having us add to the mix the undisclosed informant's tip about a green Volvo station wagon containing drugs.
Although the judge himself placed no reliance on the tip, it is plain from one of the arresting officer's testimony that, unsurprisingly, such information played a major part in leading him ""to believe that a possible drug transaction [had] occurred.""  Because we can affirm the denial of the motion to suppress on any ground fairly supported by the record, see Commonwealth v. Va Meng Joe,
, 102 (1997), we must evaluate whether considering the tip here makes a difference.
b.  The import of the tip.  The Supreme Judicial Court has made it clear that the Commonwealth cannot rely on an informant's tip unless the reliability of that tip has been demonstrated pursuant to the two-pronged Aguilar-Spinelli test (in which courts are to assess the extent to which the informant's veracity and basis of knowledge have been shown).  See Commonwealth v. Upton,
Page 345

, 375 (1985), citing Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108 (1964), and Spinelli v. United States, 393 U.S. 410 (1969).  In continuing to adhere to the Aguilar-Spinelli test in the context of challenges brought pursuant to art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, the court on multiple occasions has rejected calls that it adopt the less demanding ""totality of the circumstances"" test employed by the United States Supreme Court in challenges brought pursuant to the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.  See Upton, 394 Mass. at 371-375 (rejecting the rule adopted in Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213 [1983]).  See also Commonwealth v. Lyons,
, 18 (1990) (declining to follow the rule stated in Alabama v. White, 496 U.S. 325, 328 [1990]); Commonwealth v. Mubdi,
, 395-396 (2010).
In its brief, the Commonwealth appears to maintain that where, as here, the tip is not the sole basis for the police action, the Aguilar-Spinelli test does not apply.  Rather, the Commonwealth seems to suggest, the information received from the informant can be considered as one factor among others that collectively tip the scales.  In this manner, the Commonwealth effectively advocates for a ""totality of the circumstances"" test that the Supreme Judicial Court has time and again rejected.  Under existing case law, if the requisite level of suspicion depends on an informant's tip, that tip must satisfy Aguilar-Spinelli.
Here, nothing in the record establishes the informant's basis of knowledge or his or her veracity.  Indeed, although the Commonwealth refers to the information the undisclosed informant provided as an ""anonymous tip,"" this actually overstates its force.  An anonymous tip -- such as one made by an unidentified caller to 911 -- typically includes some information that is helpful to assessing the caller's basis of knowledge or reliability.  See Commonwealth v. Depiero,
, 452-453 (2016) (anonymous 911 caller reported seeing drunk driving in Cambridge, with the vehicle ""swerving all over the road"").  The Commonwealth not only failed to make any evidentiary showing with regard to these issues, but also expressly foreswore attempting to do so when the evidentiary hearing began.

That said, the cases have long recognized that while the
Page 346
Commonwealth will need to demonstrate a tip's reliability based on ""the informant's reliability and his or her basis of knowledge[, i]ndependent police corroboration may make up for deficiencies in one or both of these factors.""  Commonwealth v. Lyons, supra at 19.  Thus, while the Aguilar-Spinelli test must be satisfied, there is more than one way of doing so.  Moreover, in the context of reasonable suspicion, the demonstrated reliability of an informant's tip need not be as robust as what is needed to demonstrate probable cause.  Lyons, supra.  The question then is whether the observations the police made at the scene provided sufficient corroboration of the tip to establish its reliability for purposes of assessing reasonable suspicion.
At most, the police observations corroborated the unexceptional fact that at some undisclosed point in time, a green Volvo station wagon would be in the identified neighborhood.
As the Supreme Judicial Court recently observed, ""Corroboration of purely innocent details that are observable by any bystander, such as the description of a vehicle and its location, provides only limited enhancement to the reasonable suspicion determination.""  Commonwealth v. Pinto,
, 365 (2017).  To the extent the Commonwealth argues that the brief curbside interaction between the defendant and the unidentified pedestrian corroborated the tip that there were drugs inside of a green Volvo station wagon, we are unpersuaded.
See Commonwealth v. Mubdi, 456 Mass. at 387, 398-399  (fact that a person was observed interacting with defendant and other occupant of defendant's vehicle and started to walk away from the vehicle after seeing approaching police officers held insufficient to corroborate informant's tip about a purportedly illegal sale of a firearm).  Compare Commonwealth
Page 347
v. Dasilva,
, 560 (2006) (anonymous tip that defendant illegally possessed a firearm was corroborated by police observations that, ""[a]fter looking directly at the marked police cruiser, the defendant moved his right hand toward his waistband, fled up the stairs of the building where he was standing, and continued to flee even after [a police officer] ordered him to stop"").  Without a sufficient showing that the informant's tip should be considered reliable, it cannot be relied upon to demonstrate reasonable suspicion.

Conclusion.  The judge was correct not to rely on the informant's tip.  However, without such reliance, his ruling that the police had reasonable suspicion to order the defendant out of his vehicle cannot stand.  In turn, without a valid exit order, the police cannot rely on their discovery of the wad of money in the driver's door, and the police therefore lacked probable cause to search his vehicle.  ""Because the evidence in issue was traceable to . . . the illegal order[] that the defendant[] leave the car, it must in these circumstances be suppressed as the 'fruit of the poisonous tree.'""  Commonwealth v. Loughlin,
, 63 (1982).  The order denying the defendant's motion to suppress is reversed.
So ordered.

I agree with much of the majority's thoughtful decision.  Respectfully, however, I dissent on the crucial issue -- whether, at the time that the officers told the defendant to get out of the vehicle, they had a reasonable suspicion to believe that he had engaged in an illegal drug transaction.  The stop itself clearly was justified by the earlier traffic violation, a conclusion that the defendant does not really dispute.  The motion
Page 348
judge explicitly credited the officers' testimony ""that [the defendant] made [a] turn [from Copeland Street through the intersection at Warren Street and onto Waverly Street] without using any turn signal.""

Background.  As the majority notes, the judge's findings were careful and thorough.  First, he found that, at the time of the encounter, the two lead officers, Fabiano and Gero, ""were both experienced narcotics investigators.""  They were assisted by officers from the District B-2 anti-crime unit.  ""That afternoon they were looking to intercept and stop a green Volvo station wagon because an unidentified informant had told Fabiano that he could find such a vehicle in the area of Waverly and Copeland Streets in Boston and that the vehicle would contain a large amount of illegal narcotics.""
When the officers stopped the defendant driving a green Volvo station wagon, they knew:  first, the defendant had stopped his vehicle on Waverly Street, in front of the first building on the left, ""a residential building.""  Second, ""a second man immediately left the nearest building and walked to the driver's door of [the defendant's] vehicle[.  A]s the second man approached[, the defendant] leaned down to his right as if he were reaching toward the floor by the front passenger seat,"" using both hands.  Third, the defendant then sat back up and interacted for no more than thirty seconds with the second man, who stood immediately outside the driver's door of the defendant's vehicle.  During this interaction, the second man leaned toward the vehicle as if he were placing his hands on the vehicle's door or reaching into the vehicle; he ""was moving one or both of his arms while he was standing next to the Volvo and facing [the defendant], in a manner consistent with the two men exchanging something.""  Fourth, after approximately thirty seconds, the defendant drove away and the second man walked back into the building he had emerged from a moment earlier.  The motion judge found that, ""[b]ased on their training and experience with hand-to-hand drug transactions, [the officers] both suspected that the pedestrian had purchased some kind of illegal drugs from [the defendant].""
At the time that the officers ordered the defendant out of the vehicle, they had some additional information.  They had asked
Page 349
for his license and registration, noting that the defendant ""seemed to be nervous . . . [and] that [he] seemed to be breathing heavily, was looking in his rear view and side view mirrors at the various police officers and vehicles that had pulled up behind him, and was not making eye contact"" with either of the officers who were speaking with him.  Finally, while the judge declined to use the talismanic words ""high crime area"" and, in fact, specifically found that, as of this date, ""the Boston police had no reason based on past experience to expect to see a drug transaction take place on Waverly Street or Copeland Street, which are both relatively quiet residential streets,"" he also ""credit[ed] Of[ficer] Gero's testimony that over the years he ha[d] made numerous arrests for possession or distribution of illegal narcotics in this general neighborhood.""

Discussion.  1.  Exit order.  The law is clear that a police officer may order a driver to get out of a vehicle when he has a reasonable suspicion that the driver has committed a crime.  See Commonwealth v. Bostock,
, 621-622 (2008).  Therefore, as noted, the issue is whether the officer had reasonable suspicion when he ordered the defendant out of the vehicle.
""[R]easonable suspicion is a lower standard than probable cause.""  Commonwealth v. Smigliano,
, 492 (1998). See Commonwealth v. Hill,
, 63 (2000):
""The specific facts on which the police based their stop of the defendant have been described as follows:  '(1) a vehicle pulled up and an interaction occurred between someone in the vehicle and someone [in the parking lot], who apparently retrieved something before concluding the interaction with the vehicle's occupant; (2) [the interaction occurred] in a place known by the police officer[s] as a place of high incidence of drug traffic; and (3) [the interaction was] witnessed by an experienced officer, who had made numerous drug arrests [although not necessarily in the neighborhood] and considered the event as [suggesting] a drug sale.'  Commonwealth v. Kennedy, 426 Mass. [703], 708 [1998].  Moreover, 'the quickness of the interaction between [the other
Page 350
party and the defendant] reasonably could be interpreted by the officer as suspicious conduct, similar to the suspicious conduct of the ""furtive"" transaction observed in [Commonwealth v. Santaliz,
, 241 (1992)].'  Commonwealth v. Kennedy, supra at 708-709.  We are mindful that in Kennedy the seller had been arrested previously for narcotics sales and was the subject of complaints from people in the neighborhood, id. at 704; that in Santaliz, there was an obvious exchange of an object and money, supra at 240; and that in both Kennedy and Santaliz the officers had had considerable experience with drug transactions in the same location.  However, in each of those cases the facts were deemed sufficient to establish probable cause for arrest.
"" (emphasis supplied).
See also Commonwealth v. Santiago,
, 579 (2015) (""Although [the officer] did not see any item actually exchanged, the defendant's extended arm and [the recipient's] corresponding gesture in relation to his shirt pocket provided some basis for [the officer's] belief that a drug transaction between the two men had just taken place"").
I also suggest that art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights does not require us to ignore completely the fact that the officers made their observations after receiving a tip that a green Volvo station wagon containing a ""large"" amount of drugs would be in the area of Waverly and Copeland Streets.  Certainly, the tip by itself did not satisfy either prong required by the teaching of Aguilar-Spinelli.
However, viewing the tip as one of a number of factors contributing to reasonable suspicion does not, as the majority fears, impermissibly weaken the standard to a mere ""totality of the circumstances.""  See Commonwealth v. Depiero,
, 452 (2016) (""[T]he information gleaned from the anonymous call in the present case, corroborated by other information, was sufficiently reliable to warrant a finding that the officer had reasonable suspicion to stop the defendant's vehicle"").  In this case, the tip was corroborated by the fact that someone driving a green Volvo station wagon engaged in what the officers
Page 351
reasonably suspected was a drug transaction some fifty feet up Waverly Street from the intersection of Waverly, Copeland, and Warren Streets.
The majority does not cite to any case holding that such a tip must be disregarded completely, and there are a number of other cases that hold otherwise.  See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Anderson,
, 623, cert. denied, 568 U.S. 946 (2012) (""Where the caller is anonymous, there are at least two ways to establish the caller's reliability.  The first is through independent corroboration by police observation or investigation of the details of the information provided by the caller.  See . . . Florida v. J.L., 529 U.S. 266, 270 [2000], quoting Alabama v. White, 496 U.S. 325, 327 [1990] [anonymous tip, suitably corroborated, may exhibit 'sufficient indicia of reliability to provide reasonable suspicion to make the investigatory stop']""); Commonwealth v. Wilson,
, 395-396 (2004) (""Independent police corroboration of the details in the telephone call by [the t]rooper . . . when he arrived at the location identified by the caller and saw a group of nine men establishes that the caller's information was also reliable.  Commonwealth v. Willis,
, 819 [1993]"").
Finally, the fact that the tip predicted a future event (the Volvo would arrive at the particular intersection containing drugs) also buttresses its credibility.  See Commonwealth v. Va Meng Joe,
, 104 (1997) (""Corroboration of future behavior, which goes beyond 'readily available information,' has a special significance when determining the reliability of an informant"").
""For more than seventy-five years, we have avoided an overly formulaic approach to the determination of whether there is [reasonable suspicion to detain] a person who is suspected of participation in a street-level drug transaction.""  Commonwealth v. Sanders,
, 660 (2016).  ""'A police officer may make an investigatory stop ""where suspicious conduct gives the officer reasonable ground to suspect that a person is committing, has committed, or is about to commit a crime."" . . . The action of the officer ""must be based on specific and articulable facts and reasonable inferences therefrom, in light of the officer's experience.""'  Commonwealth v. Gomes,
, 510-511 (2009), quoting Commonwealth v. Wilson, 441 Mass. [at] 394.""  Commonwealth v. Stewart,
, 261 (2014).
While certainly, as the majority observes, there are many possible explanations for each of the facts individually (yes, the defendant could have been dropping off Celtics tickets, and yes,
Page 352
the defendant likely was nervous because there were several police officers), police officers do ""not have to exclude all the possible innocent explanations for the facts in order to form a reasonable suspicion.""  Commonwealth v. Isaiah I.,
, 823 (2008).  ""Although nervous or furtive movements do not supply reasonable suspicion when considered in isolation, they are properly considered together with other details to find reasonable suspicion.""  Commonwealth v. DePeiza,
, 372 (2007).  ""We view the 'facts and inferences underlying the officer's suspicion . . . as a whole when assessing the reasonableness of his acts.'  Commonwealth v. Thibeau,
, 764 (1981).  'Seemingly innocent activities taken together can give rise to reasonable suspicion justifying a threshold inquiry.'  Commonwealth v. Watson,
, 729 (2000).""  Commonwealth v. Gomes, 453 Mass. at 511.  ""We do not examine each fact known to [police] at the time of the stop in isolation; instead we view the 'facts and inferences underlying the officer's suspicion . . . as a whole when assessing the reasonableness of his acts.'""  Commonwealth v. Isaiah I., supra, quoting Commonwealth v. Thibeau, supra.  I am satisfied that, in the case before us, all the facts together support the judge's conclusion that the exit order was properly grounded in reasonable suspicion.
2.  Search.  After the defendant got out of the Volvo, one of the police officers observed in plain view a roll of money packaged in a clear plastic bag and tucked into the compartment on the inside of the driver's door.  This observation -- a large sum of cash -- together with the officers' reasonable suspicion that the defendant had just engaged in a drug transaction gave them probable cause to believe that the vehicle would contain evidence of the drug transaction, as well as evidence that the defendant was in possession of illegal drugs, intending to distribute them.  Compare Commonwealth v. Stephens,
, 385 (2008).  The police could then search the Volvo without a warrant under the motor vehicle exception.  See Commonwealth v. Johnson,
, 49-50 (2011).
I believe that the judge's order denying the motion to suppress should be affirmed.",,
COMMONWEALTH vs. EDWA,"At a criminal trial, the judge correctly denied the defendant's motion to suppress evidence, where an informant's tip, corroborated by police, gave reasonable suspicion to stop the defendant's vehicle, and where the defendant's actions in response to the lawful stop of his vehicle, including his throwing a package of cocaine out of the car as he attempted to flee, gave rise to probable cause to arrest him. [209-211]
At the trial of a criminal case, the judge incorrectly excluded evidence of police brutality at the time the defendant was arrested, which was relevant to the asserted bias of the police witnesses; where the credibility of those witnesses was the main issue at trial, the error required a new trial. [211-213]
Where a criminal defendant denied at trial any involvement in the crime of trafficking in cocaine charged, the judge did not err in refusing to charge on any lesser included offense. [213-214]
INDICTMENT found and returned in the Superior Court Department on December 11, 1996.
A pretrial motion to suppress evidence was heard by Richard F Connon, J., and the case was tried before Constance M. Sweeney, J.
Wendy H. Sibbison (Mark Mastroianni with her) for the defendant.
Dianne M. Dillon, Assistant District Attorney, for the Commonwealth.","DREBEN, J. The defendant appeals from his conviction of trafficking in excess of twenty-eight grams of cocaine. We reverse
Page 209
his conviction and remand for a new trial because all evidence of police brutality was excluded so as to preclude the defendant from conveying the issue of police bias to the jury. The credibility of the police witnesses was a critical issue at trial. We discuss only those issues that are relevant to a new trial.
1. Motion to suppress. The motion judge found the following facts. Based on a tip of a confidential informant that the defendant would arrive at Truman Circle in Springfield between 4:45 and 5:00 P.M. on November 20, 1996 to make a delivery of cocaine, police awaited the defendant. When he arrived, officers in vehicles approached the defendant's car in an attempt to block it, but the defendant drove over the curb and managed to pull away. [Note 1] No guns were drawn. Police pursuing the defendant saw the driver throw an item out of the passenger side window. One of the police cars stopped to retrieve the item, later identified as 66.83 grams of cocaine. Before finally rolling to a stop because of a flat tire, the defendant went through two red lights. He alighted from his vehicle, and a foot chase ensued. After a struggle, during which the defendant received some injuries the judge found them superficial - he was handcuffed and arrested. Thereafter, a beeper and a cell phone were found in the car, and $1,100 in cash was found on his person.
The defendant claims there was an insufficient basis for finding probable cause or reasonable suspicion for the seizure. [Note 2] He properly concedes that the informant was reliable. The officer receiving the tip, Thomas Scanlon of the narcotics bureau of the Springfield police department, testified that the informant had previously provided information which had led to the seizure of narcotics and convictions in at least five cases.
What the defendant challenges is the informant's basis of knowledge. Scanlon testified that he had spoken by telephone with the informant concerning the defendant on three occasions on November 20, as well as several weeks before. During the second call on November 20, Scanlon asked the informant to find out when one of the narcotics deliveries was going to occur. On the third phone call, the informant stated he was present and participated in an arrangement for a street dealer, who regularly had business with the defendant, to call the defendant in his
Page 210
vehicle and make plans for a delivery. The informant then told Scanlon that the defendant would be driving a certain color Honda Accord and would deliver drugs between 4:45 and 5:00 P.M. at Truman Circle. Scanlon did not ask for a description of the defendant or of his clothing as he knew the defendant. Truman Circle is a small street with just ten houses on it. The defendant's car, as predicted, arrived at 4:45 P.M.
The informant's tip was based on hearing only the street dealer's part of the conversation and hence was not based entirely on personal knowledge (and presumably was based upon some hearsay). The deficiency was, however, compensated by police corroboration. The informant's description of the expected behavior of the defendant, i.e., his arrival at a certain short street, Truman Circle, in a specified car at a stated time, was verified by the police. See Commonwealth v. Stevens, 362 Mass. 24 , 28 (1972); Commonwealth v. Bakoian, 412 Mass. 295 , 301-302 (1992). See also Commonwealth v. Powers, 39 Mass. App. Ct. 911 , 913 (1995). In these circumstances, the police had reasonable suspicion to effectuate a Terry stop. (Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 21 [1968].) As the motion judge found, once the defendant fled and threw the item to the ground, his actions elevated the suspicion to probable cause to arrest. See Commonwealth v. Sweezey, ante 48, 52 (2000), and cases cited.
Contrary to the defendant's contention, the motion judge was not required to conclude that the police action in attempting to block the defendant's vehicle constituted an arrest rather than a Terry stop. ""The distinguishing feature of a Terry stop is that the intrusion is temporary, and in degree it is not excessive or incommensurate with the accomplishment of its purpose."" Commonwealth v. Fitzgibbons, 23 Mass. App. Ct. 301 , 306 (1986). ""Blocking generally will be reasonable when the suspect is in a vehicle because of the chance that the suspect may flee upon the approach of police with resulting danger to the public as well as to the officers involved."" Id. at 304 (citation omitted). Commonwealth v. Blake, 23 Mass. App. Ct. 456 , 460 (1987). Here, although a number of police cars awaited the defendant, they were out of his sight. Only two were present when he attempted to flee. (The defendant claimed he only heard one, see note 1, supra.) The intrusion was not incommensurate with the purpose of precluding flight.
The fact that some of the police thought they were converging on the defendant to arrest him did not convert the stop into
Page 211
an arrest, see Commonwealth v. Cook, 419 Mass. 192 , 198 (1994), nor did the Commonwealth's concession that the police officer's intent was to arrest the defendant, if there was such a concession, bind the motion judge or this court to apply a probable cause standard. See Commonwealth v. Va Meng Joe, 425 Mass. 99 , 102, 106 n.9 (1997) (court obligated to accept a factual concession, but can ignore legal conclusions).
In sum, the judge did not err in declining to apply the probable cause standard and in concluding that the attempt to block the defendant was based on reasonable suspicion. There was no error in the denial of the motion to suppress the cocaine.
2. Exclusion of evidence of police bias. At the hearing on the motion to suppress, the accounts of what happened when the police caught up with the defendant varied significantly. Both the defendant and a high school student, one Oliver Duncan, testified that the defendant alighted from the car with his hands up, was grabbed by police officers, handcuffed, and then kicked and beaten. Pictures and medical records confirmed that the defendant had been injured. The defendant also testified that the next day he went back to press charges to ""Internal Affairs"" at the police station.
On the day prior to trial, when motions and other matters were discussed, defense counsel indicated that he had several witnesses ""who [would] testify that [the defendant] was beaten by the police after being handcuffed in a prolonged protracted, violent manner."" This testimony, he claimed, would ""go directly towards the credibility of the police."" The trial judge responded that she saw no reason for the admissibility of this evidence and would not permit it to come into evidence at that time [Note 3]. The issue, she said, was whether or not the defendant had the drugs. Whether excessive force was used in the arrest was a collateral matter. The judge also indicated that should the matter become meaningful during the trial for some reason she
Page 212
did not then appreciate, counsel was to alert her and she would take another look. [Note 4]""
""[E]vidence of bias is almost never a collateral matter."" Commonwealth v. LaVelle, 414 Mass. 146 , 153 (1993). ""The right of a criminal defendant to cross-examine a prosecution witness to show the witness's bias, and hence to challenge the witness's credibility, is well established in the common law, in the United States Constitution (Sixth Amendment), and in the Constitution of the Commonwealth (art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights)."" Commonwealth v. Bui, 419 Mass. 392 , 400, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 861 (1995). ""If, on the facts, there is a possibility of bias, even a remote one, the judge has no discretion to bar all inquiry into the subject."" Ibid. The defendant must ""make a plausible showing that the circumstances existed on which the alleged bias is based."" Id. at 401. As stated in Blair v. United States, 401 F.2d 387, 389 (D.C. Cir. 1968), ""It is of course clear that the range of evidence that may be elicited for the purpose of establishing bias of a witness is quite broad and that accordingly evidence of police brutality is admissible for such purposes"" (footnote citing 3 Wigmore, Evidence s.s. 943-953 [3d ed. 1940] omitted).
Possible bias of police witnesses was an important question in this case. All nine prosecution witnesses were members of the narcotics division of the Springfield police department. If brutality had occurred, they would have had a motive to cover up the beating to protect themselves or their fellow officers. See Commonwealth v. Maffei, 19 Mass. App. Ct. 924 (1984). The medical evidence and photograph introduced at the motion to suppress, and the testimony of the defendant, of the high school student Oliver Duncan, and even that of the officers concerning the defendant's injuries, gave plausibility to the claim of untoward behavior by the police.
Page 213
The case against the defendant hinged on the credibility of the witnesses. At trial, the police claimed that the defendant threw the drugs out the window of his car. When they finally caught up with him, he resisted arrest and they had to subdue him. They saw no one other than the defendant leave the vehicle [Note 5]. On the other hand, the defendant's five witnesses put a third person in the car who, the defendant claimed, must have thrown the drugs. A number of these witnesses testified that when the defendant alighted from the car, he had his hands raised. In these circumstances, it was error to exclude all cross-examination and direct evidence of police brutality [Note 6], [Note 7]. On retrial, the judge will have discretion to limit such evidence if redundant, but not to exclude it entirely.
Cases elsewhere support the view that evidence of police brutality may indicate bias of police witnesses. See, e.g., United States v. Padilla, 869 F.2d 372, 379 n.3 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 492 U.S. 909 (1989); Lutherman v. State, 348 So. 2d 624, 625 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1977); People v. Lenard, 79 Ill. App. 3d 1046, 1049 (1979); McKinley v. State, 465 N.E.2d 742, 746-747 (Ind. Ct. App. 1984); City of Xenia v. Burton, 128 N.E.2d 134, 136 (Ohio Ct. App. 1953); Lansdale v. State, 143 Tex. Crim. 167, 168 (1942). See also Commonwealth v. Maffei, 19 Mass. App. Ct. at 924.
3. Other matters. The defendant's account of what occurred complete denial of involvement - did not, without more, ""provide a basis for requiring a lesser included offense instruction"" on possession because such evidence ""in no way negated"" the defendant's intent to distribute the cocaine. See Commonwealth v. Egerton, 396 Mass. 499 , 504 (1986). ""It is true . . . that the jury were free to disbelieve all, or any portion, of (the police testimony),"" id. at 505; for example, they were free
Page 214
to disbelieve that the large quantity of cocaine indicated trafficking. ""The judge's duty to charge on lesser included offenses, however, is not coincident with the jury's unique prerogative as the ultimate fact finder. The judge need not reconstruct all possible factual scenarios subsumed in the evidence presented, no matter how unreasonable, and charge the jury accordingly. There must be some evidence on the element differentiating the greater and lesser offenses."" Ibid. Although the judge probably would not have been in error in giving an instruction based on the defendant's hypothesis, if rational, on the evidence taken in its entirety, see Commonwealth v. Thayer, 418 Mass. 130 , 133 (1994) (if on any hypothesis of the evidence, the jury could have found the lesser offense, giving an instruction to the jury on this crime is not error), such an instruction was not required. Accordingly, there was no error in the judge's refusal to charge on the lesser included offense. As the remaining contentions of the defendant are not likely to arise on retrial, we see no need to discuss them.
For the reasons stated in part two of this opinion, the judgment is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the Superior Court for a new trial.
So ordered.","March 8, 2000 - October 11, 2000",
COMMONWEALTH vs. NICHOLAS ,"At the trial of indictments for trafficking in cocaine and possession of a firearm without a firearm identification card, the evidence was sufficient to warrant the jury's conclusion that the defendant had constructive possession of a quantity of cocaine found by police pursuant to a warrant in a hidden compartment in an apartment rented by the defendant [626-628]; however, there was not sufficient evidence that the defendant intended to or did exercise dominion or control over the firearm, which was found in the same compartment [628].
At a criminal trial, testimony from a police officer regarding ""information received"" from an informant was properly admitted with limiting instructions to explain why the police took certain actions. [628-630]
At a criminal trial, a police officer's repeated inadmissible and improper responses that the defendant was not cooperative were properly addressed by the judge's striking the testimony and giving forceful curative instructions: defense counsel's failure to move for a mistrial was not, in the circumstances, manifestly unreasonable.

The cases were tried before Constance M. Sweeney, J. Leslie W. O'Brien for the defendant.
Sidney E. Reavey, Assistant District Attorney, for the Commonwealth.","BECK, J. The defendant was convicted of trafficking in over 200 grams of cocaine, two counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon (a motor vehicle), and possession of a firearm without a firearm identification card. (The jury found the codefendant, Luis Martinez, not guilty of trafficking and posses

On appeal, the defendant argues that (1) there was insufficient evidence he had constructive possession of 500 grams of cocaine and a gun found in a ""well-hidden secret compartment""; (2) the admission of hearsay violated his constitutional rights; and (3) his counsel was constitutionally ineffective for not requesting a mistrial when a police officer testified that the defendant refused to cooperate after the officer read him his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966). With the exception of the firearm charge, we affirm.
Facts. The essential facts are not in dispute. On the afternoon of September 7, 1996, about a dozen Springfield police officers were participating in an investigation and surveillance of activities at an apartment building located at 135 Belmont Avenue, Springfield. At about 4:00 P.m., the defendant and Luis Martinez left the apartment building through a rear entrance and drove off in a gray Honda Accord. The car was registered to Jose Lopez. The defendant drove to the Diaz Supermarket. The two men entered the market for a ""short time,"" got back in the car, and returned to the apartment building. Two hours later, the defendant and Martinez again left the apartment building through the rear door, and drove away in the Honda. This time they passed through the same supermarket parking lot and drove to Chicopee. In Chicopee, Martinez got out of the Honda and walked up to the front porch of a house at 13 Cochran Street. There was a man on the porch. Martinez gave the man a small item and the man gave Martinez some paper currency in exchange. Martinez and the defendant then returned to 135 Belmont Avenue.
At about 8:30 P.m., Officer Joselito Lozada received a telephone call from ""an individual"" who apparently informed Lozada that the defendant would soon be making a delivery. Lozada notified the other officers and the team prepared to intercept the defendant. Lozada stationed himself opposite apartment 7A behind a fire door which had a small window in it. He saw the defendant and Martinez leave apartment 7A and go down a staircase to the basement. The defendant was carrying a brown paper bag. After radioing the officers in the parking lot behind the building, Lozada followed the defendant and Martinez through the basement and into the parking lot. There he saw the defendant get into the gray Honda. As the defendant began to drive away, unmarked cruisers pulled in front of and behind the Honda. Officers on foot also appeared and identified
Page 625
themselves as police officers. In response, the defendant put the Honda in reverse and sped backwards. In doing so, he struck the cruiser behind him, hitting one of the officers who was getting out of the cruiser and knocking the cruiser into another officer. The Honda stopped after striking a cement pillar. As a number of officers converged on the Honda, the defendant reached down in front of his seat. Both the defendant and Martinez refused to unlock their doors. At least in part in response to movement inside the Honda, one of the officers smashed the driver's side window and the officers forcibly removed the men from the Honda. The defendant responded by ""kicking and grabbing onto the steering wheel"" and attempted to grab the cement pillar as he was pulled out of the car. After handcuffing the defendant, the officers put him in the back seat of a marked cruiser, where he tried to kick the back windows out.
The police searched the Honda in the place they had seen the defendant reaching and found a ""small brown McDonald's bag"" containing what appeared to be cocaine. The cocaine was wrapped in a paper towel, and then in tinfoil, before being placed in the McDonald's bag. Sergeant Thomas Meleady removed a key ring from the Honda's ignition. He and several other officers went down to the basement and up the stairs to apartment 7A. One of the keys on the ring fit the door of apartment 7A. After determining that there was no one in apartment 7A, they secured the apartment and waited for Lozada to return with a warrant. Lozada and another officer secured apartment 9B.
After obtaining a warrant, the police searched both apartments 9B and 7A. The former appeared uninhabited and had apparently suffered water damage. That apartment yielded no contraband or other evidence. (They also searched 7B with the consent of the occupant and found nothing there either.)
A search of apartment 7A yielded different results. Officer Williams, who had attended ""secret compartment school, . . . a [Drug Enforcement Administration] federally funded school, that teaches . . . about hidden compartments,"" was assigned to search the rear bedroom. After checking and removing the contents of the closet, Williams noticed ""a fresh strip of molding running from one end of the closet door to the other end of the closet door, with fresh nailing in it."" When Williams grabbed the molding to see if he could pull it off, ""the entire closet floor came up."" In the compartment Williams and one or two other
Page 626
officers found cocaine, McDonald's bags identical to the one containing cocaine that was found in the Honda, packaging material, cut powder containers, scales, other drug paraphernalia, and a handgun. There were also two Dominican Republic passports, neither of which was in the defendant's name. Other documents were found in apartment 7A as well, none of which connected the defendant to the apartment, including rent receipts to Wanda Lopez and Jose Lopez, utility bills for Wanda Nunez, and phone bills for Jose Lopez.
The cocaine found in the car weighed approximately seventy grams and had a purity of almost seventy-five percent. There were five other packages of cocaine in the hidden compartment with the following weights and purity: 99.33 grams, 189% purity [sic]; 242.8 grams, 40% purity; 7.13 grams (no evidence as to purity); 58.57 grams, 46.56% purity; and 96.93 grams, 78.22% purity.
The building manager testified that the defendant had been staying at 135 Belmont Avenue for a few months. During the summer he had been staying in apartment 9B, which was rented to Jose Lopez at the time, although the building manager had not seen Lopez in a couple of months. The defendant had paid the rent for apartments 7A, 7B, and 9B a couple of times and had returned the keys to apartment 9B earlier on September 7. Lozada testified that at the police station the defendant said he had just arrived in Massachusetts the day before and was staying with a friend whose name he could not remember.
1. Constructive possession. At the conclusion of the Commonwealth's evidence, the defendant moved for a required finding of not guilty on the ground that the Commonwealth had not introduced sufficient evidence he possessed either the cocaine or the gun. See Commonwealth v. Latimore, 378 Mass. 671 , 676677 (1979). The Commonwealth's theory of the case was that the defendant had constructive possession of both.
In order to prove that the defendant had constructive possession of the cocaine and gun found in the hiding place in apartment 7A, the Commonwealth was required to show that the defendant had ""knowledge [of the cocaine and the gun] coupled with the ability and intention to exercise dominion and control"" of them. Commonwealth v. Brzezinski, 405 Mass. 401 , 409 (1989), quoting from Commonwealth v. Rosa, 17 Mass. App. Ct. 495 , 498 (1984). ""Proof of possession of a controlled substance may be established by circumstantial evidence, and
Page 627
the inferences that can be drawn therefrom."" Commonwealth v. Brzezinski, 405 Mass. at 409, quoting from Commonwealth v. LaPerle, 19 Mass. App. Ct. 424 , 426 (1985). We examine the evidence supporting possession in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. See Commonwealth v. Rosa, 17 Mass. App. Ct. at 499.
First, there was evidence connecting the defendant to apartment 7A. Most clearly, the defendant was seen coming out of that apartment carrying a small brown paper bag just before his arrest. He had been seen coming out of the same rear door of 135 Belmont Avenue two times earlier in the day. The police had also seen him at 135 Belmont Avenue four times in July of the same year. Moreover, he had paid the rent on apartment 7A, as well as other apartments in the building, on more than one occasion. The keys for apartment 7A were on the same key ring as the keys for the Honda that the defendant was driving at the time of his arrest.
The police retrieved a small brown paper bag from the place in the Honda where the defendant was seen to be reaching just before his arrest. The bag recovered from the location had a McDonald's logo and was identical to bags found in the secret hiding place in apartment 7A. ""In some cases a defendant's connection to a stash of narcotic drugs [may be] established largely by the close similarity of the narcotic drugs in his actual possession . . . to the narcotic drugs in the stash."" Commonwealth v. James, 30 Mass. App. Ct. 490 , 495, 496 n.8 (1991), citing as an example Commonwealth v. Brown, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 988 (1981), as well as out-of-State cases. Compare Commonwealth v. Washington, 50 Mass. App. Ct. 167 , 169-170 (2000) (reversing allowance of motion for required findings of not guilty on ground of sufficiency of evidence of constructive possession in trafficking case). Contrast Commonwealth v. Cruz, 34 Mass. App. Ct. 619 , 621-622 (1993) (mere presence even if combined with knowledge not sufficient to show joint control); Commonwealth v. Navarro, 39 Mass. App. Ct. 161 , 167-169 (1995) (defendant at apartment in possession of bags of heroin with skull and cross bones similar to those police had purchased, along with syringe, but no evidence defendant rented, occupied, or spent a great deal of time at apartment).
The cocaine in the bag had a high degree of purity of nearly seventy-five percent. Some of the cocaine found in the cache was of a similarly high purity. There were scales and packaging
Page 628
materials on the kitchen table. The existence of this paraphernalia in plain view is another factor that may support an inference of constructive possession of a stash of a controlled substance. See Commonwealth v. Pratt, 407 Mass. 647 , 652 (1990); Commonwealth v. Rivera, 31 Mass. App. Ct. 554 , 557 (1991). Finally there was the defendant's concerted effort to escape from the police. See Commonwealth v. James, 30 Mass. App. Ct. at 497 (behavior of defendant and his group in response to arrival of police relevant strand of evidence connecting defendant to contraband in apartment).
The defendant claims that the Commonwealth has failed to meet its burden because it did not prove that no one remained in apartment 7A after he left. Apparently the defendant's theory is that there was a third person who actually controlled access to the hidden compartment who left the building during the melee in the parking lot. However, ""[t]he Government . . . need not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence, provided the record as a whole supports a conclusion of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt."" Commonwealth v. Merola, 405 Mass. 529 , 533 (1989), quoting from United States v. Systems Architects, Inc., 757 F.2d 373, 377 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 847 (1985). See Commonwealth v. Rivera, 31 Mass. App. Ct. at 557. While perhaps not overwhelming, compare Commonwealth v. Pratt, supra, there was sufficient evidence from which a jury could have found that the defendant knew there was a substantial amount of high quality cocaine in the compartment; that he exercised dominion and control over it by removing seventy grams and putting it in a McDonald's bag that he also removed from the hidden compartment; and that he left the apartment with it.
On the other hand, the evidence regarding the gun is substantially weaker. While it seems likely the defendant knew the gun was in the compartment, there is insufficient evidence that he intended to or did exercise dominion or control over it. It was not in the Honda or on the defendant's person at the time of his arrest. Nor was there evidence, such as clothing or papers, of a personal connection between the defendant and the room in which the stash was located. Compare Commonwealth v. Sadberry, 44 Mass. App. Ct. 934 , 935-936 (1998). (We also note that it is not entirely clear that the gun was actually introduced in evidence.)
2. Hearsay. Officer Lozada testified that, after receiving a telephone call from an individual, he
Page 629
""informed [the other officers] that [he] received information that there was going to be a delivery made at approximately 9:00 P.m. . . . And [the officers] knew what apartment [the defendant] was in. [The defendant] had just recently moved from one apartment to the other. So [the officers] wanted to make sure that [they] saw [the defendant] coming out of the apartment.""
Defense counsel made a timely objection. The judge overruled the objection and instructed the jury that what Lozada had said was ""hearsay testimony . . . but it's being offered to explain why people took certain actions. It's not to substitute for your judgment as to what actually happened.""
Assuming that the informant supplied the information about the apartment as well as about the delivery, the defendant claims that his State and Federal constitutional rights were violated because he could not cross-examine the person who supplied the information. However, the statement at issue here was not hearsay because it was not admitted for the truth of the matter asserted, but for another valid purpose. Commonwealth v. Miller, 361 Mass. 644 , 659 (1972).
It is well-settled that the police may testify as to extrajudicial statements in order to ""explain what they did in consequence of conversations with others."" Commonwealth v. Soto, 45 Mass. App. Ct. 109 , 113 (1998) (collecting cases). Moreover, the judge gave prompt and accurate instructions as to the use the jury could make of the testimony. In any case, even supposing the testimony had been admitted as evidence of an imminent delivery, the jury had already heard evidence of an earlier transaction, and it was not the delivery that was at issue but the defendant's connection to the secret stash.
Nor was there any risk of a miscarriage of justice, see Commonwealth v. Freeman, 352 Mass. 556 , 564 (1967), in Officer Efantis's unobjected-to testimony that a maintenance worker told the officers securing apartment 9B that the people who had lived there had moved to apartment 7A. First, defense counsel used the hearsay evidence to his advantage in his closing argument by emphasizing that this testimony conflicted with Lozada's testimony. (Testimonial inconsistencies and ineptness in the investigation were primary themes in the defendant's
Page 630
closing argument.) Second, given the building manager's testimony connecting the defendant with three different apartments, this hearsay testimony had little additional probative force, especially because there was no physical evidence as to exactly where the defendant was living. There is no plausible reason to infer that the verdict might have been different but for the alleged error. Commonwealth v. Miranda, 22 Mass. App. Ct. 10 , 21 (1986).
3. Ineffective assistance of counsel. Finally, the defendant claims his trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to move for a mistrial when Lozada testified that the defendant had refused to cooperate after having been read his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436. We address the defendant's argument because the factual basis for the claim appears clearly on the record. See Commonwealth v. Adamides, 37 Mass. App. Ct. 339 , 344 (1994).
The offending testimony was as follows:
""I went in and I gave him his Miranda rights. We were trying to speak to him to see if he would . cooperate, but he refused to cooperate.""
There was a prompt objection and the court ordered the testimony ""stricken."" The prosecutor then set out again. After establishing that Lozada had given the defendant his Miranda rights in Spanish, the prosecutor asked whether Lozada had a conversation with the defendant. Lozada answered, ""No. He wasn't cooperating."" There was an immediate objection.
An obviously exasperated judge called counsel to the side bar and characterized Lozada's testimony as ""totally improper."" She also noted that
""this cop has done this before. I have had to sit here on other trials, and he does the same thing every time he takes the witness stand. I'm pretty tired of it. And the District Attorney's office better worry about it. He's not going to testify if this keeps up.""
Upon the prosecutor's representation that he expected Lozada to relate a conversation with the defendant in ""regards to where [the defendant] was living and why he was up here,"" the judge allowed a final series of questions on this point. The judge then instructed the jury as follows:
Page 631
""Before we go to cross examination . . . you are to strike from any consideration any assertion that the defendant did not cooperate with the officer. That is gratuitous opinion that has been offered to you that, number one, was not asked of him. What was asked of him was what was said.
And you'll remember what I told you that, first of all, there's absolutely no requirement on anybody's part who is accused of a crime to cooperate with anyone, including the police. That is fundamental. It is immaterial whether anyone cooperates or not. And the officer knows that and should not have testified to that once, let alone twice.
Therefore, I have to strongly give you this instruction so you understand the importance of it and you understand that that is not to be considered by you. It should be disregarded by you. If anything, you should look on it negatively that for some reason the witness felt the need to offer it to you. If there is any negative inference to be drawn, it's to the one stating it, not towards the defendant.""
There is no question that Lozada's testimony was inadmissible and improper and infringed on the defendant's rights pursuant to Miranda v. Arizona, supra. See Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610, 619 (1976). However, the absence of a motion for a mistrial did not constitute ""serious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel."" Commonwealth v. Saferian, 366 Mass. 89 , 96 (1974). First, ""[a] trial judge retains broad discretion in deciding whether to grant a mistrial."" Commonwealth v. Thomas, 429 Mass. 146 , 157 (1999). Second, ""[p]rompt, forceful, critical instructions, such as were given here, can obviate any prejudice and eliminate any constitutional basis for a claim that a defendant was entitled to a mistrial."" Commonwealth v. Morgan, 369 Mass. 332 , 342 (1975), cert. denied, 427 U.S. 905 (1976). ""[T]he judge's response here was sufficient to protect the defendant's constitutional rights."" Ibid. Third, the judge's unusually forceful instructions were clearly critical of Lozada, the Commonwealth's primary witness. As suggested above, the defendant's closing argument focused on the inept investigation, e.g., the failure to dust for fingerprints, the failure to examine the trash Martinez deposited in a dumpster in the parking lot just before the police closed in, the haphazard manner in which the police reported and secured the evidence, and the conflicting
Page 632
testimony of the nine officers who testified at trial. Given this approach, defense counsel could well have concluded that an instruction that was sharply critical of Lozada did more for the defense than another trial without either the allegedly offending testimony or the judge's critical comments. Certainly such a choice would not be manifestly unreasonable. See Commonwealth v. Martin, 427 Mass. 816 , 822 (1998). In the face of the evidence of the defendant's efforts to avoid arrest in the parking lot, Lozada's testimony that the defendant did not cooperate can hardly have been a surprise to the jury. In these circumstances, the testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See Commonwealth v. Vermette, 43 Mass. App. Ct. 789 , 797-799 (1997). Compare Commonwealth v. Mahdi, 388 Mass. 679 , 695-696 (1983) (setting out factors to consider in evaluating whether Miranda violation is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt).
The judgment of conviction and sentence on the charge of possession of a firearm is vacated, and the indictment is to be dismissed. The remaining judgments are affirmed.
So ordered.","April 14, 2000 - December 28, 2000",
COMMONWEALTH vs. TWANE,"Testimony and other evidence presented to a grand jury were sufficient to establish probable cause on indictments charging the defendant with cocaine possession with intent to distribute and cocaine possession with intent to distribute in a school zone. [602-603]
Evidence presented to a grand jury was not sufficient to establish that the defendant had probably possessed a firearm or ammunition without an identification card, actually or constructively, and the indictment charging that offense was properly dismissed. [604]
The judge in a criminal case properly allowed the defendant's motion to suppress evidence seized by the police during a warrantless search of her person and of an automobile in which she was riding where, absent adequate corroboration, a tip by a confidential informant did not demonstrate sufficient indicia of reliability to give rise to a finding of probable cause either to arrest the defendant or to search her, and where, on the evidence available to the police at the time of the arrest and search, the police did not have probable cause to stop the defendant's automobile, to arrest her, or to believe that the automobile in which she was riding contained contraband. [604-610]
The judge in a criminal case erred in refusing to suppress a quantity of cash, ammunition and other items seized in the search of the defendant's apartment and the cellar of the building in which the apartment was located, where information obtained by the police during a warrantless search of her person and her automobile in violation of the defendant's constitutional rights, even if in good faith, could not be considered in the determination of probable cause and could not support the issuance of a warrant to search the apartment and cellar.

Thomas H. Townsend, Assistant District Attorney, for the Commonwealth.
William R. Hill, Jr, Committee for Public Counsel Services, for Twanesha Hill.","LAURENCE, J. Twanesha Hill was indicted, along with another individual, Corey Hightower, for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute (in violation of G. L. c. 94C, s. 32A), such possession and intent within a school zone (in violation of G. L. c. 94, s. 32J), and possession of ""a firearm or ammunition"" without an identification card (in violation of G. L. c. 269, s. 10[h]). Hill filed pretrial motions to dismiss the indictments against her; to suppress items discovered by the police during a warrantless search of her person and of an automobile in which she was riding; and to suppress other items subsequently seized from her apartment in execution of a search warrant.
Following a combined evidentiary hearing on the several motions, a Superior Court judge allowed Hill's motion to dismiss the indictments and her motion to suppress the fruits of the warrantless search, but denied her motion to suppress the evidence obtained from the search of her apartment. A single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court allowed the Commonwealth's applications for interlocutory appeal of those rulings and reported the appeal to this court for determination. See Mass.R.Crim.P. 15(a)(1) & (2), as appearing in 422 Mass. 1501 -1502 (1996) [Note 1]. We reverse the allowance of Hill's motion to dismiss the indictments for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and such possession and intent to within a school zone, but affirm the allowance dismissing the indictment for possession of a
Page 600
firearm or ammunition. We affirm the allowance of Hill's motion as to the warrantless search of the automobile and reverse the denial of her motion as to the search of her apartment.
1. Background facts. The motion judge made the following findings, after the combined hearing (the evidence at which consisted of the testimony of Springfield police officers Jackson, Santaniello, and Trites, along with the search warrant and supporting affidavit and the grand jury transcript). The Springfield police department had, at some unspecified time, received reports from several different, unnamed sources that one side of a two-story duplex house at 16 Gold Street was a distribution point for crack cocaine. Hill and Hightower were allegedly dealing cocaine from that apartment by using a ""beeper system"" to communicate with customers and delivering cocaine to customers in a red Plymouth Neon automobile. In addition, some customers were allowed to enter the apartment to purchase cocaine. One of the anonymous sources claimed to have been, at an indeterminate time or times, inside the apartment and to have witnessed an undisclosed number of drug sales involving Hill and Hightower and the placement of orders for cocaine (inferentially by the beeper system). One of the sources was said to be a ""confidential informant"" who on prior occasions had supplied officer Jackson with information, which Jackson had ""corroborated."" Jackson did not, however, describe the dates or the nature of that information, nor the manner in which it had been corroborated. The confidential informant was not identified as the source who had allegedly witnessed drug transactions inside the apartment.
After receiving this information, Jackson and fellow-officer Santaniello began conducting surveillance of the suspect address. The officers were aware that Hill had been convicted four years earlier for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and trafficking in cocaine and that Hightower had been previously arrested for possession of some sort of handgun without a permit. Over about a two-week period prior to June 10, 1994, they confirmed that Hill and Hightower were in residence and watched them come and go in the red Neon. They also observed ten instances where unknown individuals entered the apartment, remained a short time, then departed.
Page 601
Short visits of that type were consistent with transactions involving the sale of narcotics. The ten instances did not, however, involve ten different individuals, and none of the individuals seen entering the apartment was known to the officers as having been involved in drug activity. The officers did not ascertain whether either Hill or Hightower was present during those ten visits.
On June 10, 1994, at a time when the red Neon was parked nearby, the two officers observed an automobile containing a female passenger known to Jackson as Mari Werner arrive at 16 Gold Street. Werner entered the apartment for a ""short time,"" returned to the vehicle, and drove away. Jackson knew that Werner had been arrested the previous week, found in possession of cocaine, and charged with possession with intent to distribute cocaine. Jackson and Santaniello followed Werner's vehicle, stopped it at a nearby intersection, and ordered the occupants out. Asked if she had any cocaine in her possession, Werner admitted that she did and surrendered four plastic bags containing what appeared to be cocaine. Werner did not, however, admit or state that she had obtained the cocaine at 16 Gold Street. She was then arrested and transported to police headquarters.
The circumstances of Werner's arrest were communicated to additional police officers, including Sergeant Trites, who took up surveillance at 16 Gold Street. The surveilling officers observed Hill and Hightower leave the apartment ""shortly after"" Werner was arrested and drive away in the red Neon. Trites and the other officers followed the red Neon into the parking lot of the Glenwood Elementary School (which, testimony revealed, was attended by Hill's son). Trites positioned his vehicle behind the Neon, while another police vehicle ""box[ed it] in"" from the front. Trites did not speculate that the Neon contained cocaine; rather, aware that a warrant application to search the suspects' apartment was in progress, he intended to detain and question them until the warrant issued.
The officers left their vehicle and approached the Neon in plain clothes. They displayed their badges, but did not draw their weapons. Hightower, the driver, looked shocked and 46 made a quick motion towards the console"" area of the
Page 602
automobile. (This movement did not, however, provoke safety fears on the part of the officers.) Trites, looking through the driver's door window, saw, ""in plain view,"" the comer of a plastic bag in the area between the driver's seat and the console. He knew that such a plastic bag was a common container for narcotics. Hill and Hightower were ordered out of the Neon. Trites retrieved the plastic bag, which contained three additional plastic bags, each containing a substance that appeared to be cocaine. The officers then searched Hill and Hightower; each had about $400 in cash, and Hill had a ""pager"". Both were arrested.
Upon receiving this information and an affidavit from Santaniello, a clerk magistrate issued a warrant for the search of the 16 Gold Street apartment for cocaine and related paraphernalia. During the search of the apartment, police recovered personal papers belonging to Hill and Hightower, bank books, identification cards, pictures, and $6,000 in cash inside a pair of men's sneakers in a bedroom. ""In the cellar of 16 . . . Gold Street,"" officers found ""128 rounds of ammunition, one clip and clip feeder, and one empty gun container [Note 2].""
2. Sufficiency of the indictments. Relying on Commonwealth v. McCarthy, 385 Mass. 160 (1982), the judge dismissed Hill's indictments after concluding that the Commonwealth had failed to present to the grand jury sufficient evidence to suggest that Hill was at any time in actual or constructive possession of the drugs or ammunition at issue. Accordingly, he ruled that the grand jury lacked probable cause to believe that Hill had committed a crime.
Under the applicable principles [Note 3], we are satisfied that the testimony and other evidence presented to the grand jury were
Page 603
sufficient to establish probable cause on the indictments charging Hill with cocaine possession with intent to distribute and cocaine possession with intent to distribute in a school zone. The grand jury heard evidence that Hill - a convicted drug dealer identified as continuing in the cocaine distribution business by a police informant claiming personal knowledge - was at least inferentially present when a known drug user and suspected dealer visited her building; that following that visitor's arrest immediately after leaving 16 Gold Street, the police found cocaine in the visitor's possession; that Hill and Hightower left the apartment shortly after the user's arrest and proceeded in a car to a schoolyard; that at the schoolyard during a search, police found in that car a substantial amount of cocaine packaged for resale, found in Hill's possession a common accoutrement of the drug trade (a pager), as predicted by the informant, and a significant amount of cash, and also found in Hightower's possession a significant amount of cash; and that in her apartment the police discovered a very large stash of cash.
The totality of that evidence warranted a person of reasonable caution to conclude that Hill had probably committed the charged drug offense (contrast McCarthy, 385 Mass. at 163 [no evidence of criminality presented to grand jury]), in that, she could be rationally deemed to have had actual or constructive possession of the cocaine seized from her car and to have intended to distribute it within a school zone. See Commonwealth v. Collado, 426 Mass. 675 , 679-680 (1998); Commonwealth v. Francil, 15 Mass. App. Ct. 35 , 37 (1982); Commonwealth v. Clarke, 44 Mass. App. Ct. 502 , 509-510 (1998). The judge erred in dismissing those two indictments [Note 4].
Page 604
The same cannot be said of the indictment charging Hill with unlawful possession of the ammunition seized from the cellar at 16 Gold Street. The Commonwealth failed to present evidence that the cellar was part of Hill's apartment or of the common area of the building, or that Hill controlled or exercised dominion over the cellar in any manner. The Commonwealth introduced nothing indicating that Hill had at any time been present in the cellar or was aware of its contents. Neither did the Commonwealth claim to have found in the cellar any item identifiably belonging to or associated with Hill, such as personal papers or effects, or otherwise connecting her to the cellar. Nor was there any evidence that Hill had ever acquired or possessed or been seen with any ammunition or firearms [Note 5]. In short, the Commonwealth failed to present to the grand jury any evidence from which a person of reasonable caution could conclude that Hill had probably possessed the ammunition at issue, actually or constructively, and the indictment charging that offense was properly dismissed. See and compare Commonwealth v. McCarthy, 385 Mass. at 163-164; Commonwealth v. Zuluaga, 43 Mass. App. Ct. 629 , 636-637, 640-641 (1997); Commonwealth v. Clarke, 44 Mass. App. Ct. at 509-510; Commonwealth v. Tam, 49 Mass. App. Ct. 31 , 38 (2000); Commonwealth v. Delarosa, 50 Mass. App. Ct. 623 , 628 (2000).
3. Motion to suppress evidence from the warrantless searches. A search is presumed unreasonable unless conducted under the authority of a valid warrant supported by a showing of probable cause. Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 357 (1967). Commonwealth v. Forde, 367 Mass. 798 , 800 (1975). The searches of his and her car were not performed under the auspices of a warrant. Nonetheless, the Commonwealth (which has the burden of proof in such situations, see Commonwealth v. Phillips, 413 Mass. 50 , 55 [1992]) asserts that they were valid under two
Page 605
theories recognizing exceptions to the general principle: first, that the search of the car was conducted incident to Hill's and Hightower's lawful arrest, see G. L. c. 276, s. 1; and alternatively, by virtue of the so-called automobile exception. See Commonwealth v. Motta, 424 Mass. 117 , 122-124 (1997). Finding no probable cause for either the arrest or for application of the automobile exception, we agree with the judge's ruling allowing Hill's motion to suppress the evidence seized in the warrantless search of her and the car.
A search incident to an arrest is generally valid provided the police have probable cause to arrest, see Commonwealth v. Peters, 48 Mass. App. Ct. 15 , 21-22 (1999), and the search does not exceed a permissible scope. G. L. c. 276, s. 1. ""Probable cause to arrest exists when, at the moment of arrest, the facts and circumstances known to the police officers were sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution in believing that the defendant had committed or was committing a crime."" Commonwealth v. Gullick, 386 Mass. 278 , 283 (1982). Similarly, for a search to be valid under the automobile exception, the officers must have had probable cause to believe that the car contained contraband (although no particular exigency beyond the inherent mobility of a motor vehicle need be shown). See Commonwealth v. Motta, 424 Mass. at 122-123; Commonwealth v. Watson, 430 Mass. 725 , 733 (2000).
The Commonwealth contends that the evidence summarized at 600-602, supra, particularly the confidential informant's tip and the Werner incident, provided the police with probable cause to arrest Hill and Hightower and to search their car under both exceptions to the warrant requirement [Note 6]. We disagree. Probable cause may be based on an informant's tip, but the prosecution must establish that the tip was trustworthy, i.e., that it bore such indicia of reliability that one acting upon it can ""know that he is relying on something more substantial than a casual
Page 606
rumor circulating in the underworld or an accusation based merely on an individual's general reputation."" Spinelli v. United States, 393 U.S. 410, 416 (1969).
A tip will be deemed trustworthy only if it satisfies the Aguilar/Spinelli [Note 7] criteria of reliability; it must set forth ""(1) some of the underlying circumstances from which the informant concluded that the contraband was where he claimed it was (the basis of knowledge test), and (2) some of the underlying circumstances from which the affiant concluded that the informant was 'credible' or his information 'reliable' (the veracity test)."" Commonwealth v. Upton, 394 Mass. 363 , 374-375 (1985). If the informant's tip fails either aspect of the Aguilar/Spinelli test, other information reasonably known to or acquired by the police that corroborates the tip may support a finding of probable cause; but ""each element of the test must be separately considered and satisfied or supplemented in some way."" Id. at 376.
Applying the Aguilar/Spinelli standards here, we conclude, as did the judge below, that the tip from the confidential informant was unreliable. Despite the lack of detail and precision in the tip, contrast Commonwealth v. Robinson, 403 Mass. 163 , 166 (1988); Commonwealth v. Cast, 407 Mass. 891 , 892 (1990); Commonwealth v. Welch, 420 Mass. 646 , 651-652 (1995), we accept the judge's conclusion that, because the informant allegedly saw and was present when Hill and/or Hightower took drug orders in the apartment, the informant demonstrated an adequate ""basis of knowledge,"" so that the first prong of the Aguilar/Spinelli formula was satisfied. See Commonwealth v. Parapar, 404 Mass. 319 , 322 (1989) (statement of informant that he obtained drugs three times from same person in specific apartment allows clear inference of personal observation). The informant's ""veracity,"" however, was fatally deficient.
Our initial concern is that the informant failed to indicate when any observed illegal activity had taken place, what exactly had happened, how often (and recently) the informant had observed this activity, or what the informant's role in such activity had been. As the Commonwealth conceded at argument,
Page 607
such a dearth of both temporal and substantive detail does not provide an adequate basis for us to determine whether the information provided by the informant is sufficiently veracious to justify an invasion of Hill's constitutionally protected zone of privacy. Compare Commonwealth v. Upton, 394 Mass. at 377378; Commonwealth v. Malone, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 70 , 73-74 (1987) (several isolated incidents of selling drugs fourteen months, one month, and two weeks prior to informant's tip constituted stale information insufficient to establish probable cause); Commonwealth v. Morton, 26 Mass. App. Ct. 949 , 950 (1988) (failure of informant to specify time of observations constitutes a ""serious defect"" militating against finding of probable cause); Commonwealth v. Oliveira, 35 Mass. App. Ct. 645 , 648 (1993) (even a highly detailed tip would not serve to satisfy the veracity requirement).
A more significant defect impairs the reliability of the informant's tip. Although the informant allegedly had provided useful information on prior occasions, the Commonwealth did not indicate (as the judge noted) what the nature of that other information was or when or in what context it had been provided or verified. Further, there was no showing that the information had led to any convictions, seizures of contraband, or even arrests. ""Boiler plate"" assertions lacking such substantive detail are not adequate to satisfy Aguilar/Spinelli's veracity prong. See and compare Commonwealth v. Rojas, 403 Mass. 483 , 486 (1988); Commonwealth v. Lapine, 410 Mass. 38 , 41-42 (1991); Commonwealth v. Mei a, 411 Mass. 108 , 113-114 (1991); Commonwealth v. Santana, 411 Mass. 661 , 664-665 (1992); Commonwealth v. Byfield, 413 Mass. 426 , 431 (1992).
Nor did the police investigation and surveillance corroborate the informant's tip in any meaningful manner. As the judge found, prior to the arrest the police had confirmed only that Hill and Hightower resided at the identified residence and owned or operated a car fitting the informant's description, that Hill some four years earlier had been convicted of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, and that one known drug user/dealer who had just visited the building was found in possession of cocaine. Significantly, the police observed no actual drug transactions and at best minimal foot traffic, involving unidenti-
Page 608
fied persons, during their two-week surveillance. The officers did not see either Hill or Hightower using any ""beepers"" or other drug paraphernalia or engaging in any activity more suspicious than taking short motor trips away from their residence, to destinations unknown and for purposes uncertain. Indeed, the officers were unable to testify that the persons who infrequently visited the building (none of whom the police followed upon their departure) had at any time in fact met with Hill.
Because the information supposedly corroborated by the police was essentially such as was commonly available and as consistent with Hill's innocence as with criminal activity, it does not constitute adequate corroboration under Aguilar/Spinelli. See Commonwealth v. Helme, 399 Mass. 298 , 301 (1987) (""[t]oo many alternative explanations, all of them innocent, exist which could explain the facts as presented to the officer and negate any suspicion that 'a person has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime' ""); Commonwealth v. Alvarado, 423 Mass. 266 , 272-274 (1996) (corroboration of innocent details insufficient to satisfy veracity prong); Commonwealth v. Motta, 34 Mass. App. Ct. 921 , 922 (1993) (confirmation of name and address provided by informant is not sufficient to satisfy veracity prong). Neither the fact of Hill's four year old drug conviction nor the arrest of Hightower on a weapons charge added corroborative verisimilitude to the informant's story. See Commonwealth v. Allen, 406 Mass. 575 , 579 (1990); Commonwealth v. Oliveira, 35 Mass. App. Ct. at 647. In sum, nothing observed by or known to the police adequately corroborated any of the inculpatory assertions attributed to the informant.
The Commonwealth stresses that the circumstances surrounding Werner's arrest corroborated the tip and were sufficient to clothe the search with probable cause. We are unpersuaded. When arrested shortly after visiting Hill's building, Werner admitted that she had cocaine in her pockets, but the officers did not establish when or from whom Werner had obtained the cocaine [Note 8]. Since Jackson testified that Werner was a known substance abuser and dealer, her possession of cocaine could as
Page 609
likely be attributed to events and persons wholly unrelated to Hill or Hightower as to any illegal activities in which they might have been engaged [Note 9]. Though manifestly indicative of criminal activity on Werner's part, the circumstances of Werner's arrest were no more consistent with Hill's guilt than with her innocence. The Werner incident, therefore, was insufficient to elevate the tip above the level of ""a casual rumor circulating in the underworld or an accusation based merely on an individual's general reputation."" Spinelli v. United States, 393 U.S. at 416. See Commonwealth v. Frazier, 410 Mass. 235 , 240 (1991) (mere association with cocaine dealer, without more, does not provide probable cause to arrest associate or to search associate's handbag); Commonwealth v. Sampson, 20 Mass. App. Ct. 970 , 971 (1985) (observation of defendant seated next to gaming suspect who acted furtively on seeing officer not sufficient to give rise to probable cause to believe defendant engaged in illegal gambling). Cf. note 4, supra.
In the absence of adequate corroboration, the informant's tip did not demonstrate sufficient indicia of reliability to give rise to a finding of probable cause either to arrest Hill or search her. See Commonwealth v. Rojas, 403 Mass. at 486. Disregarding the informant, at the time of the arrest and search the police collectively knew (see Commonwealth v. Gullick, 386 Mass. at 283) the following: (1) Hill and Hightower resided in an apartment at 16 Gold Street and operated a certain car; (2) over a two week period, ten, though probably fewer, persons made short visits to the apartment; (3) a known drug user and dealer visited the apartment building on one occasion for a brief period
Page 610
and later was found to have cocaine on her person; (4) Hill and Hightower left their apartment after the drug dealer was arrested and drove to a schoolyard; (5) after being ""boxed in"" by the police in the schoolyard (not described as a high-crime area or scene of drug activity), Hightower ""made a move"" toward the console area of the car (though the occupants did nothing to create police concern for their safety); and (6) an officer saw a portion of a plastic bag peeking out of the area between the console and the driver's seat [Note 10].
We concur with the judge in concluding that, on this evidence, the police did not have probable cause to stop Hill's car, to arrest her, or to believe that the car in which she was riding contained contraband. See Commonwealth v. Frazier, 410 Mass. at 240; Commonwealth v. Alvarado, 420 Mass. at 555; Commonwealth v. Sampson, 20 Mass. App. Ct. at 971; Commonwealth v. Garcia, 34 Mass. App. Ct. at 650. Compare and contrast Commonwealth v. Santaliz, 413 Mass. 238 , 241 (1992) (suspect in high-crime area engaged in furtive, transaction-like conduct with another; sufficient probable cause for experienced officer to arrest for drug sale); Commonwealth v. Rivera, 27 Mass. App. Ct. 41 , 42, 45 (1989) (probable cause to arrest for drug possession when, as officers approached in a high-crime area, suspect shoved plastic baggy into pants); Commonwealth v. Peters, 48 Mass. App. Ct. 15 , 21 (1999) (search incident to arrest valid where police saw defendant, in the presence of female companion, engage in drug transaction and where female companion acknowledged that she had drugs in her pocket). We agree with the judge's rejection of the Commonwealth's effort to validate the search of Hill's car and person as either incident to a lawful arrest or as an automobile search and see no error in his ordering suppressed the cocaine and other materials seized as a result of the warrantless searches.
4. Motion to suppress products of the building search.
Page 611
Although we could decline to consider Hill's appellate contention that the judge effed in refusing to suppress the cash, ammunition and other items seized in the search of her apartment and the cellar at 16 Gold Street [Note 11], we address the issue, not only because the parties have fully briefed it, but also because we are persuaded that substantial justice will thereby be served. See also Commonwealth v. Simpson, 428 Mass. 646 , 648-649 (1999).
The affidavit on the basis of which the warrant issued provided (1) substantially the same information possessed by the police at the moment they stopped and approached the car Hill occupied in the schoolyard (see supra at 600-602), supplemented by (2) the items discovered in the search of that car and of Hill's and Hightower's persons. Those items were a plastic bag that Hightower had been observed stuffing between his seat and the console, containing three additional plastic bags with a white rock substance in each that later proved to be cocaine, about $400 in cash taken from each individual, and a pager found on Hill. Even under the applicable deferential standard of review [Note 12], this warrant fails judicial muster.
Page 612
The totality of the first category of information has already been adjudged, in the immediately preceding section, to be inadequate to establish probable cause. The second category the tainted fruits of the warrantless searches of the car and Hill - cannot be utilized to bolster the first insufficient quantum of evidence, because information obtained by the police in violation of constitutional rights - even if in good faith - may not be considered in the determination of probable cause and cannot support the issuance of a warrant in this Commonwealth. See Commonwealth v. Forde, 367 Mass. 798 , 807-808 (1975); Commonwealth v. White, 374 Mass. 132 , 138-139 (1977), aff'd, Massachusetts v. White, 439 U.S. 280 (1978); Commonwealth v. Meehan, 377 Mass. 552 , 568-569 (1979); Commonwealth v. D'Onofrio, 396 Mass. 711 , 713-718 (1986). Cf. Commonwealth v. Hall, 366 Mass. 790 , 792-798 (1975); Commonwealth v. Pietrass, 392 Mass. 892 , 900-901 (1984); Commonwealth v. Treadwell, 402 Mass. 355 , 356 n.3 (1988); Commonwealth v. Hecox, 35 Mass. App. Ct. 277 , 282 n.6 (1993) [Note 13].
5. Conclusion. The order dismissing the indictments against Hill for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and such possession and intent within a school zone is reversed; the order dismissing the indictment against Hill for possession of a firearm or ammunition is affirmed; the order suppressing the evidence
Page 613
seized during the search of Hill's car and person is affirmed; the order denying Hill's motion to suppress the evidence seized during the search of her apartment and the cellar is reversed; and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.

COMMONWEALTH vs. HENRY ROSENT,"A State police officer assigned to the Massachusetts State Racing Commission at Suffolk Downs was warranted, on the basis of an informant's tip, in conducting an initial, noncustodial inquiry of the defendant concerning drug activity at the racetrack; however, where the officer, in the absence of any other lawful basis (reasonable suspicion or probable cause) to justify his actions, used the pretext of an administrative search to further detain and search the defendant's person, when the sole object of his investigation was to uncover evidence of drug activity, the fruits of the search could not be used in a subsequent criminal proceeding against the defendant.[710-716]
INDICTMENT found and returned in the Superior Court Department on September 19, 1997.

Harris Krinsky, for the defendant.
Kajal K. Chattopadhyay, Assistant District Attorney, for the Commonwealth.","DUFFLY, J. Following a jury-waived trial, a judge of the Superior Court found the defendant guilty of possession of a class B substance with intent to distribute. G. L. c. 94C, s. 32A(a) [Note 1]. The defendant appeals, claiming error in the denial of his pretrial motion to suppress cocaine found on his person.
Page 708
We reverse the judgment because we agree that the evidence was obtained during the course of a search initiated on the pretext that it was an administrative inspection, when the sole object of the investigation was to uncover evidence of illegality and there were no other circumstances justifying the warrantless search of the defendant's person.
Facts. We summarize facts found by the judge who heard the motion to suppress. As in Commonwealth v. Alvarado, 423 Mass. 266 , 268 n.2 (1996), ""[t]he motion judge's findings do not incorporate all the testimony of the police officer who [conducted the search and] testified at the hearing on the motion to suppress . . . . We also refer to uncontroverted. testimony of the police officer because we infer that the motion judge accepted it in its entirety.""
On March 1, 1997, at approximately 3:00 P.m., a confidential informant approached State police Officer Steven Hines, who was assigned to the Massachusetts State Racing Commission at Suffolk Downs, at his office located in a trailer on the grounds of Suffolk Downs race track. The confidential informant told him that earlier that day, as well as on the preceding day, the informant had been approached by a person he identified only as ""Rosenthal,"" who had offered to sell him cocaine.
The informant had been the subject, some eight weeks earlier, of a Social Security Administration investigation into the illegal use of social security numbers at the track. Hines told the informant that they might be able to assist him with his legal problems related to social security fraud if he agreed to be the ""eyes and ears"" of the police. [Note 2] The informant, who was given one week to provide information regarding drug problems at the track, was asked to pay attention to the ""backside"" of Suffolk Downs, an area containing barns, horses, grooming areas and employee residences, known for drug activity.
The informant did not provide a physical description of Rosenthal, or state that he had observed any drugs. He did tell Hines that Rosenthal was in Barn 16, and that Hines should get there right away because it was feeding time and Rosenthal
Page 709
would be leaving soon [Note 3]. Hines hurried to Barn 16, where he observed a man and a woman working with a horse. The man, who did not appear to be in the process of leaving, identified himself as Rosenthal. Hines was in plain clothes, but armed with a loaded handgun. He identified himself as a State trooper and, as found by the motion judge, he ""then told the defendant that he needed to search his tack room and wanted him to be present [Note 4]. The trooper's motive was to convince the defendant that he was going to perform an administrative search of the tack room. At that time, the trooper did not have direct information that drugs were in the tack room. Rather, Trooper Hines had been told by the [confidential informant] that the defendant probably had drugs on his person.""
The defendant complied, and accompanied Hines to the tack room. As the defendant walked alongside him, Hines observed a plastic bag sticking out of the defendant's sweatshirt pocket; he also observed bulges in each of the defendant's sweat pants pockets. At Hines's request, the defendant retrieved the plastic bag from his sweatshirt pocket, showing Hines that it contained medals made to be worn on a chain. By this time, the two had reached and entered the tack room, and Hines asked the defendant what was in his pants pockets. The defendant emptied his left pants pocket, removing a wallet. When Hines asked to see what was in the right pants pocket, the defendant became agitated and said there was nothing in it, and demanded to see his Horseman's Union representative. At that point Hines reached over to attempt to pat the pocket, and the defendant backed up, with hands raised and out of his pockets. Hines then told the defendant he was in fear for his life and that he would
Page 710
search him if he did not remove what was in his pocket [Note 5]. Hines did not remove his weapon from his holster in an effort to protect himself At that point, the defendant asked if they could go to another area of the barn before he removed the object. There the defendant removed from his right pocket five foil packets that, according to Hines, were folded in a manner commonly used to contain cocaine. Hines reached into the right pocket of the defendant's sweat pants and pulled out a clear plastic bag that was also found to contain cocaine folded in a piece of paper [Note 6].
Discussion. With respect to these facts, we ""make an independent determination of the correctness of the judge's application of constitutional principles . . . ."" Commonwealth v. Hill, 49 Mass. App. Ct. 58 , 62 (2000). We do not agree with the motion judge's conclusion that ""an investigatory stop of the defendant"" was justified on the basis of the tip. We conclude that the informant's tip was not reliable and that it failed to provide the informant's basis of knowledge [Note 7].
The mere possibility that a drug transaction was afoot, while
Page 711
not rising to the level of reasonable suspicion that a crime was being committed, did, however, permit Hines to conduct an initial, noncustodial inquiry. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Stoute, 422 Mass. 782 , 789 (1996) (""not every encounter between a law enforcement official and a member of the public constitutes an intrusion of constitutional dimensions requiring justification""). Simply put, there was nothing to prevent the officer from going to the barn, a location not imbued with expectations of privacy, to observe the defendant and engage him in conversation. This initial encounter between Hines and the defendant did not implicate constitutional protections.
We now consider whether Hines's decision to prolong the encounter by ordering the defendant to accompany him to the tack room was justified. Having observed the defendant engaged in innocent activity in the barn, Hines nevertheless sought to proceed with a criminal investigation in the hope of discovering contraband. Using the pretext that he was about to conduct an administrative search, Hines told the defendant to accompany him in a search of the tack room.
The defendant argues on appeal, as he did in support of his
Page 712
motion to suppress, that the seizure of drugs that followed was illegal because it went beyond the scope of an administrative search [Note 8], and that there was no independent basis supporting the search [Note 9]. The motion judge's sole finding on this issue was that ""[Hines's] motive was to convince the defendant that he was going to perform an administrative search of the tack room.""
Page 713
He made no rulings on the defendant's claim that this was an administrative search that went too far, instead concluding that the defendant's compliance with the request that he accompany Hines to the tack room was voluntary, and that Hines was justified in conducting a limited pat frisk of the defendant to search for weapons.
In assessing whether the motion judge's conclusions were correct, Hines's stated claim, but in fact a pretext, that he was about to conduct an administrative search is significant. Our analysis does not, however, depend on a determination of the permissible scope of an administrative search [Note 10]]. Hines testified that he intended the defendant to believe that he was conducting an administrative search, but denied that the contraband was discovered in connection with an administrative search, and the motion judge appears to have credited Hines's testimony in all respects. Thus, the precise question we address is whether State police may use the pretext of an administrative search to detain a suspect in a criminal investigation, where there is no other lawful basis - reasonable suspicion or probable cause - to justify that action.
Lines are easily blurred where police officers conduct administrative searches since ""unlike administrative agents, the police have general criminal investigative duties which exceed the legitimate scope and purposes of purely administrative inspections."" Commonwealth v. Lipomi, 385 Mass. 370 , 378 (1982). In this dual capacity, it is all too easy for a police officer falsely to invoke a regulatory scheme in order to gather
Page 714
evidence of criminal activity. In the circumstances here, we conclude that the defendant's compliance with Hines's request was not free and voluntary consent, but only ""acquiescence to a claim of lawful authority"" to search under the provisions of G. L. c. 128A, s. 8A. Commonwealth v. Krisco Corp., 421 Mass. 37 , 46 (1995). If using the pretext of an administrative search to conduct a criminal investigation is unlawful then both Hines's detention of the defendant on that basis and the ancillary pat-search likewise were unlawful.
While these precise issues have not previously been decided, we find guidance in decisions that involve discovery of evidence of illegality during the course of a regulatory inspection. In Commonwealth v. Bizarria, 31 Mass. App. Ct. 370 (1991), we observed that both ""Commonwealth v. Eagleton, 402 Mass. 199 , 206 n.13 (1988), and Commonwealth v. Frodyma, 386 Mass. 434 , 438 (1982), S.C., 393 Mass. 438 (1984), make clear that an administrative search may not be used as a subterfuge to avoid the burden of establishing probable cause to support a criminal investigative search."" Commonwealth v. Bizarria, supra at 375 n.7. See also note 10, supra. In Commonwealth v. Tremblay, 48 Mass. App. Ct. 454 (2000), the defendant claimed that an administrative inspection of an auto salvage lot ""was . . . a pretext or subterfuge"" that had been motivated by suspicion of the presence of stolen cars. We ultimately rejected this claim because there ""the motion judge expressly and correctly rejected the argument of pretext."" Id. at 459-460. However, crucial to our holding in Tremblay was the fact that the State trooper ""recognized and respected a dividing line between administrative procedure and pursuit of evidence of . . . crime."" Id. at 462. Further, we cautioned that our decision ""should not be misunderstood as scanting possibilities of abuse on a pretext."" Id., citing, among other cases, People v. Scholten, 175 111. App. 3d 214, 218 (1988). The Scholten court upheld the suppression of evidence where it was established that the sole purpose of the search was to look for illegal gambling activities and that a regulatory inspection to uncover alcoholic beverage violations was a pretext, stating, ""if 'the primary object of the search is to gather evidence of criminal activity' a search warrant based on probable cause must be
Page 715
obtained."" Ibid. See United States v. Johnson, 994 F.2d 740, 742 (10th Cir. 1993) (administrative inspection may not be used as a pretext solely to gather evidence of criminal activity); Showers v. Spangler, 957 F. Supp. 584, 592 (M.D. Pa. 1997), rev'd in part on other grounds, 182 F.3d 165 (3rd Cir. 1999) (administrative inspection may not be used as pretext to gather evidence as part of what is in fact a criminal investigation).
In view of these prior holdings, we conclude that where it is clearly established, as it was in this case, that a search was initiated on the pretext of administrative authority but had as its sole purpose the investigation of criminal activity, the fruits of that search may not be used in a criminal proceeding unless an independent, constitutionally sound basis exists, at or prior to the sham invocation of such administrative authority, that would justify the seizure. See People v. Pace, 101 A.D.2d 336, 340, aff'd, 65 N.Y.2d 684 (1985) (""once the purpose behind the search shifts from administrative compliance to a quest for evidence to be used in a criminal prosecution, the government may constitutionally enter the premises only upon securing a warrant supported by full probable cause""). See also Abel v. United States, 362 U.S. 217, 225-226 (1960). [Note 11] There was no such independent basis here. [Note 12] Therefore, the seized drugs were fruits of the unlawful act and should have been suppressed. Commonwealth v. Borges, 395 Mass. 788 , 795 (1985). ""The
Page 716
order denying the motion to suppress is reversed. In this case it is clear that if the motion to suppress had been allowed, the evidence that remained would have been sufficient to support a conviction. The defendant's motion for a required finding of not guilty must be allowed."" Commonwealth v. Thibeau, 384 Mass. 762 , 765 (1981). Commonwealth v. Straw, 422 Mass. 756 , 762 (1996). The judgment is reversed, the finding is set aside, and judgment for the defendant shall enter.

Circumstances set forth in an affidavit of a police officer were insufficient to show that an informant was credible or that information provided by the informant was reliable and, consequently, physical evidence seized by the police should have been suppressed. [280-288]
The record of a hearing on a fifteen year old juvenile's motion to suppress his statements to police did not demonstrate that the police provided the juvenile with an adequate opportunity to consult with an interested adult who was informed of, and understood, the juvenile's constitutional rights, where the juvenile had been detained for two and one-half hours while his mother and other close relatives were available but were not informed of his detention; consequently, the juvenile's waiver of the right to remain silent was invalid and his statements to the police should have been suppressed.

motions to suppress: one motion challenged a search pursuant to a warrant during which physical evidence was seized, and the other sought to suppress incriminating statements of the juvenile obtained at the time of the search. Both motions were denied and the juvenile was adjudicated a delinquent on complaints charging him with breaking and entering in the day time, larceny over $250, and possession of a firearm. [Note 2] In his appeal, he claims that (1) the search was invalid as the affidavit in support of the warrant failed to establish probable cause; and (2) the statements should be suppressed because he was not accorded the protections set forth in Commonwealth v. A Juvenile, 389 Mass. 128 (1983), and hence, his waiver of the right to remain silent was invalid. We agree that both motions to suppress should have been allowed.
1. Motion to suppress physical evidence. Where, as here, a search is conducted pursuant to a warrant, probable cause must be found only on the facts revealed on the face of the affidavit and any reasonable inferences therefrom. Commonwealth v. Germain, 396 Mass. 413 , 415 n.4 (1985). Commonwealth v. Allen, 406 Mass. 575 , 578 (1990). See Commonwealth v. Upton, 394 Mass. 363 , 367 (1985). We turn to the affidavit which is set forth in relevant part in the margin. [Note 3] On January 28, 1999, the affiant, an experienced detective with the Boston police department, sought a warrant for the second-floor residence and
Page 281
other specified areas at 21 Montvale Street, in the Roslindale area of Boston. He had, within the last two hours, received information from an informant, referred to as ""X,"" ""whose whereabouts and identity [were] known"" to him, but who wished to remain anonymous. X told the affiant that he had ""observed six rifles, three shotguns, two rifles, and one air pellet rifle"" at the locus, and that there were two people currently in the house, one called Ricky, who lived there with his parents, and the other named Alfonso. Their last names were unknown to the informant and he believed that ""the parents"" (not identified) were not then at home.
X also told the affiant that Alfonso said ""that he took the guns in a Breaking & Entering on the 27th of January, 1999, in West Roxbury."" X stated that Ricky was going to put the guns in a black bag and place them in the garage, and that Alfonso ""was making several phone calls"" to find a buyer. Alfonso was asking three to four hundred dollars for each weapon and had scheduled a meeting with two prospective buyers later in the evening.
The affiant asserted that in fact there had been a breaking and entering at 24 Chestnut Street, in the West Roxbury section of Boston, on January 27, 1999, in which three 12 gauge shotguns, two 20 gauge shotguns, and a pellet gun were taken.
The warrant issued and was executed that evening, at which time numerous guns were found.
Recognizing correctly that Massachusetts adheres to the ""two pronged test"" of Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108 (1964), and
Page 282
Spinelli v. United States, 393 U.S. 410 (1969), see Commonwealth v. Upton (Upton I), 390 Mass. 562 , 568- 571 (1983), rev'd., Massachusetts v. Upton, 466 U.S. 727 (1984), S.C., Commonwealth v. Upton, 394 Mass. 363 , 374 (1985) (Upton II), [Note 4] the motion judge held that both prongs were met. We agree as to the first prong. Not only did X personally observe specific kinds of guns, [Note 5] i.e., rifles, shotguns, and an air pellet gun, see Commonwealth v. Allen, 406 Mass. 575 , 578 (1990) (""First-hand receipt of information through personal observation satisfies the basis of knowledge prong""), but he also heard Alfonso state that he had taken the guns in a breaking and entering on January 27, 1999, in West Roxbury. See Commonwealth v. Lapine, 410 Mass. 38 , 41 (1991) (hearing a conversation satisfies the basis of knowledge prong); Commonwealth v. Crawford, 410 Mass. 75 , 78-79 (1991) (basis of knowledge test satisfied by defendant's telling informant of plan).
The difficulty lies with the veracity test. None of the common bases for determining reliability is present: the affidavit does not mention successful past performance of the informant, or suggest that he or she made a statement against penal interest, or that the informer is ""an ordinary citizen"" who provided information

as a witness to a crime. See Upton I, 390 Mass. at 569-570, and cases cited. In reaching his conclusion that the veracity prong had been satisfied, the motion judge relied on the following: (1) X had provided details which included the type and number of guns, where they had been obtained, and the plan for disposing of them; (2) similar guns had been stolen in a breaking and entering, thus ""essentially corroborat[ing]"" X's information; and, (3) X's reliability was bolstered by the fact that the affiant policeman knew X's identity and whereabouts.
We recognize that ""[a]n affidavit for a search warrant . . . 'must be tested and interpreted by magistrates and courts in a commonsense and realistic fashion. . . . [T]he resolution of doubtful or marginal cases in this area should be largely determined by the preference to be accorded to warrants.' "" Commonwealth v. Germain, 396 Mass. 413 , 418 (1985), quoting from United States v. Ventresca, 380 U.S. 102, 108-109 (1965).
Nevertheless, in this case, each of the three considerations relied on by the motion judge is weak, and, even in combination, when the affidavit is read as a whole, the reliability of the information remains unsupported.
a. The degree of detail is not impressive; indeed, assuming the affidavit is taken to mean that the informant saw six rather than twelve guns, [Note 6] his claimed observation of ""six rifles, three shotguns, two rifles, and one air pellet rifle,"" while adequate to satisfy the basis of knowledge prong, is not sufficiently accurate or specific to be ""self-verifying."" See Commonwealth v. Rojas, 403 Mass. 483 , 487 (1988). The informant's description of the guns does not match the detailed description of the items stolen, namely, three 12-gauge shotguns, two 20-gauge shotguns, and a pellet gun. Compare the detailed and corroborated description in Commonwealth v. Germain, 396 Mass. at 418 (1985). [Note 7] Moreover, here, ""the informant did not provide particularized
Page 284
distinguishing characteristics of the . . . apartment, possessions, or activities."" Commonwealth v. Rojas, 403 Mass. at 487. He did not even know the last names of the persons in the apartment. [Note 8]
Moreover, this court has questioned the notion that detail, alone, uncorroborated by police investigation, is an indication of veracity. Commonwealth v. Oliveira, 35 Mass. App. Ct. 645 , 648 (1993). In that case, Justice Kaplan, writing for the court, quoted from Stanley v. State, 19 Md. App. 507, 533 (1974), with approval: ""If the informant were concocting a story out of the whole cloth, he could fabricate in fine detail as easily as with rough brush strokes. Minute detail tells us nothing about 'veracity.' "" See Grasso & McEvoy, Suppression Matters Under Massachusetts Law, §§ 10-4(c), 10- 5(b) (2001).
In sum, the details that satisfied the basis of knowledge test fell short of bolstering the informant's veracity. See Upton I, 390 Mass. at 569.
b. What details there were were not significantly enhanced by police investigation. True, there was here some corroboration. A robbery had taken place on January 27th in West Roxbury and five shotguns and a pellet gun had been stolen. But the circumstances related in the affidavit did not lend credibility to the informant. Where there has been a robbery or other criminal conduct and an informant provides facts which are not publicly known or shows knowledge of criminal behavior before the police are aware of the crime, the likelihood that the information is false is reduced. See 2 LaFave, Search and Seizure § 3.3(f), at 170 (3d ed. 1996) & at 19 (2002 Supp.).
Our cases, and cases elsewhere, accord credibility in such circumstances. Thus, in Commonwealth v. Germain, 396 Mass.
Page 285
at 415-418, after listing other factors tending to show the reliability of the informant's disclosure about the robbery, [Note 9] the court pointed to the detailed description of the items given by the informant which, police investigation confirmed, matched the detailed description given by the victims. Although the court did not specifically so state, it was most unlikely that knowledge about the items described as observed by the informant, a brown suede mask and a gray-colored handgun with rust spots on the top of the barrel, had been revealed to the public. See note 7, supra. See also the following cases where knowledge of unique details corroborated by police investigation supported the informant's credibility. Yielding v. State, 371 So. 2d 951, 957 (Ala. Cr. App. 1979), cert. denied, Ex parte Yielding, 371 So. 2d 962 (Ala. 1979) [Note 10] ; State v. Jeffcoat, 403 So. 2d 1227, 1229-1230 (La. 1981) (court noted that some items described by the informant, and confirmed by police as having been taken in two different burglaries, were ""unusual,"" e.g., a rug [in fact, a tapestry] showing deer drinking from a stream and an ""old time"" cap and ball pistol); State v. Ballard, 836 S.W.2d 560, 562-563 (Tenn. 1992) (unique charm from a bracelet in the shape of a gold outhouse with a little man sitting inside was described by both the informant and the victim); People v. Conwell, 649 P.2d 1099, 1101 (Colo. 1982), overruled on other grounds by People v. Quintata, 785 P.2d 934, 937 (Colo. 1990) (court abandoned Aguilar-Spinelli test and adopted totality of the circumstances test set forth in Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238 [1983]) (informant's description of stolen stereo equipment as Technic, Pioneer and several other brands was confirmed by victim). See State v. Carson, 320 N.W.2d 432, 434-436 (Minn. 1982) (informant's description of large quantities of pharmaceutical bottles of Dilaudid and Preludin was accorded weight, with other factors, to establish the informant's
Page 286
truthfulness). See also cases where the informant had knowledge of a crime before the police did, e.g., Harrelson v. State, 516 P.2d 390, 395 (Alaska 1973) (bad check); State v. Daley, 189 Conn. 717, 724 (1983) (theft), or where the informant had knowledge of the modus operandi of a thief in three burglaries, but the modus operandi was known only to the perpetrator and investigating officers. State v. Jones, 96 N.M. 14, 15-16 (1981).
In situations where the description or other information obtained from the informant is likely to be known by others, the information is not accorded similar reliability. Thus in Upton I, 390 Mass. at 572-573, the court did not find sufficient reliability in an affidavit (reproduced in part at 564, n.2) containing the following averments. Police, on September 11, 1980, at about 12 noon, raided a motel room reserved by a Richard Kelleher and found credit cards of two persons who had reported recent thefts of a large quantity of gold and silver jewelry. At 3:20 P.M., some three hours after the beginning of the raid, an unidentified female called police, said she had seen stolen items including gold and silver jewelry in a motor home behind the home of George Upton, that Upton had purchased these stolen items from Ricky Kelleher, and that Upton was going to move the motor home because Kelleher's motel room had been raided. Although the informant knew of the police raid shortly after it had taken place, the court held the veracity prong unsatisfied. A search of the motor home was not warranted ""based on a telephone tip from an anonymous informer who told a story connecting [the motor home] with the fact of a recent police search of a third person's room on premises to which the public had access."" 390 Mass. at 573. (Emphasis supplied). The court repeated the fact of public access to the motel in Upton II, 394 Mass. at 378, thus laying stress on the fact that the reliability of the tip could not be inferred from the circumstance that the informant knew that a third person's motel room had been raided. The public nature of the motel prevented the informant's knowledge from being sufficiently unique to be reliable.
In the present case, too, veracity cannot be inferred from the fact that the informant knew of a recent robbery and that six guns of varying description had been stolen. ""This information could indeed have been heard at a neighborhood bar, or possibly,
Page 287
could have been heard on a local news broadcast, or could have been read in the paper. More substantial verification is required."" People v. Greer, 87 Ill. 2d 89, 94 (1981), overruled in part by People v. Tisler, 103 Ill. 2d 226, 243-246 (1984) (adopting Gates test) (discussing basis of knowledge prong).
c. Nor is the veracity prong significantly enhanced by the affiant's assertion that he received information from a source ""whose whereabouts and identity are known to me and who wishes to remain anonymous."" While the ""strict requirements of reliability . . . are relaxed with respect to named and identified sources,"" Commonwealth v. Freiberg, 405 Mass. 282 , 297, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 940 (1989), the scant description of the officer's contact with the informant ""made this informant barely distinguishable from an anonymous tipster."" Commonwealth v. Grinkley, 44 Mass. App. Ct. 62 , 69 (1997). The affiant did not specify, nor can it be inferred, whether his knowledge of the identity of the informant was based on a telephone call or a personal meeting. ""[A]nyone can claim over the telephone to be a particular individual with impunity if that claim cannot be verified."" Ibid. See Upton I, 390 Mass. at 570 (informant treated as anonymous even though the officer told her over the phone that he knew who she was and the informant admitted she was that person).
In Commonwealth v. Grinkley, 44 Mass. App. Ct. at 69, despite the informant's providing the police with her name and address, she was considered to be akin to an anonymous individual as her stated identity could not be verified; she had not left a telephone number and presumably could not be reached by the police. The vague averment here that the affiant knew the identity and ""whereabouts"" of the informant ""who wishe[d] to remain anonymous,"" without any indication that he knew the name of the informant and that he could readily reach him or her, suggests even greater inaccessibility than the address found insufficient in Grinkley. See Commonwealth v. Melendez, 407 Mass. 53 , 58 n.4 (1990). See also Commonwealth v. Barros, 435 Mass. 171 , 177 n.7 (2001), and the concurring opinion of Justice Sosman at 181-182 n.5.
Even where an informant is ""named"" and his address is given, that is but one factor to be weighed. See Commonwealth
Page 288
v. Atchue, 393 Mass. 343 , 347 (1984). As carefully set out in Commonwealth v. Grinkley, 44 Mass. App. Ct. at 68-69, reviewing the authorities, our cases considering the reliability of a tip strengthened when given by a named and identified informant had significant other factors supporting the informant's reliability. In Commonwealth v. Welch, 420 Mass. 646 , 652 (1995), and in Commonwealth v. Va Meng Joe, 425 Mass. 99 , 103-104 (1997), cases relied on by the Commonwealth, not only did the affiants identify the informants by name and address, or show they were reachable, but more importantly, the informants had accurately predicted the behavior of the respective defendants, a circumstance of ""special significance when determining the reliability of an informant."" Id. at 104. In sum, since the circumstances set forth in the affidavit were insufficient to show that the informant was credible or the information reliable, the physical evidence seized should have been suppressed.
2. Motion to suppress statements. We take our facts, essentially uncontested, from the motion judge's [Note 11] findings, supplemented by uncontroverted testimony adduced at the suppression hearing. At 4:45 P.M. on January 28, 1999, escorted by an aunt or grandmother of ""Ricky,"" see note 3, supra, who had let them in, four or five police officers of the Boston police department entered and secured the second floor apartment of 21 Montvale Street, Roslindale, in anticipation of the arrival of the search warrant. Detective Luis Cruz was the first officer to enter. His gun was drawn, but at his side. There were four persons in the apartment: the juvenile; Richard McMann, the son of Charlotte Cahill (the lessee of the apartment); and two others. After the four were pat frisked for weapons, preliminary inquiries revealed that two of the persons were wanted on outstanding arrest warrants. The two were arrested and taken to a police station.
The police, the juvenile, and McMann waited two and one- half hours before the officers received information that the warrant was on route. During this period, Charlotte Cahill and McMann's stepfather returned home from work.
Page 289
While the officer awaited the warrant, McMann and the juvenile were asked to sit on the couch. Although they were not handcuffed, they were not free to leave. The juvenile was not allowed to go to the bathroom alone and was accompanied there by Detective Cruz. He was not informed that he could make a phone call, and the police did not call his mother. The parties stipulated that she was at home and that the juvenile's uncle and grandmother were also available.
At about 7:15 P.M., after receiving confirmation that the warrant was on the way, Detective Cruz and another detective began their interviews, first questioning McMann and then the juvenile. As McMann was being taken to an empty bedroom for questioning, his mother, Charlotte Cahill, approached the officers and asked whether she could be present during the interview and whether McMann should have an attorney present. Cruz responded that since McMann was an adult (he was eighteen), the choice of whether he wanted his mother present, or wanted an attorney, was up to him. McMann stated that he did not want his mother to be present during the interview. This discussion took place in front of the juvenile who was still seated on the living room sofa.
After finishing their interview with McMann, the two detectives escorted the juvenile into the bedroom. Cruz confirmed his date of birth (November 14, 1983), indicating he was fifteen years old. After reading the warnings required by Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 479 (1966), Cruz asked the juvenile whether he wanted to have his mother brought to him so she could be present during the questioning or whether he wished to consult with another interested adult, suggesting that McMann's mother and two other adults were available in the kitchen. Cruz asked this question on three separate occasions, and each time the juvenile stated that he did not want to consult with an interested adult and did not want his mother present during the interview. He stated that he had been arrested twice before and that he understood his rights. [Note 12] After waiving his rights, he admitted that he had broken into a house in West Roxbury and
Page 290
that five or six guns were taken and the guns were now at 21 Montvale Street.
After setting forth the foregoing facts (as supplemented), the judge found (1) that the juvenile was fifteen years old at the time of his arrest; and (2) was the subject of custodial interrogation. He made the following additional ""findings"" and then denied the motion to suppress the statements.
""(3) The juvenile, (name), was afforded a meaningful opportunity to consult with an adult.
""(4) The juvenile, (name), declined to have his mother or any other interested adult present during his interrogation after being repeatedly informed that he had a right to have an interested adult present.
""(5) The juvenile, (name), did knowingly and intelligently waive his Miranda Rights.
""(6) The totality of the circumstances surrounding the waiver of his Miranda Rights reveal the waiver was valid.
""(7) The waiver of his Miranda Rights [was] in no way coerced by the police.""
In reviewing the motion judge's decision, we accept his subsidiary findings of fact, but make an independent determination of the correctness of his application of constitutional principles to the facts as found. Commonwealth v. A Juvenile, 389 Mass. at 135. Commonwealth v. Berry, 410 Mass. 31 , 34 (1991). Not only does the Commonwealth have ""a heavy burden in demonstrating that a 'defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to . . . counsel,' "" Commonwealth v. A Juvenile, 389 Mass. at 135 (internal citations omitted), but here, ""where the defendant is a juvenile, courts must proceed with 'special caution' when reviewing purported waivers of constitutional rights."" Commonwealth v. Berry, 410 Mass. at 34. Commonwealth v. Philip S., 414 Mass. 804 , 808 (1993).
The leading Massachusetts case setting forth the requirements for a valid waiver of rights of a juvenile under the Fifth Amendment
Page 291
to the United States Constitution is Commonwealth v. A Juvenile, 389 Mass. 128 (1983), where at 134, the court stated:
""[F]or the Commonwealth successfully to demonstrate a knowing and intelligent waiver by a juvenile, in most cases it should show that a parent or an interested adult was present, understood the warnings, and had the opportunity to explain his rights to the juvenile so that the juvenile understands the significance of waiver of these rights. For the purpose of obtaining the waiver, in the case of juveniles who are under the age of fourteen, we conclude that no waiver can be effective without this added protection. . . . For cases involving a juvenile who has reached the age of fourteen,[ [Note 13]] there should ordinarily be a meaningful consultation with the parent, interested adult, or attorney to ensure that the waiver is knowing and intelligent. For a waiver to be valid without such a consultation the circumstances should demonstrate a high degree of intelligence, experience, knowledge, or sophistication on the part of the juvenile.""
Subsequent cases have instructed that it is ""the juvenile's opportunity to consult that is critical, not whether he avails himself of it."" Commonwealth v. MacNeill, 399 Mass. 71 , 78 (1987). Such opportunity, however, must be ""with an interested adult who was informed of, and understood,"" the constitutional rights. Commonwealth v. Berry, 410 Mass. at 35 (emphasis supplied). Commonwealth v. Hogan, 426 Mass. 424 , 430 (1998). Commonwealth v. McCra, 427 Mass. 564 , 567 (1998). Commonwealth v. Leon L., 52 Mass. App. Ct. 823 , 826-827 (2001).
This is a significant requirement. Commonwealth v. Guyton, 405 Mass. 497 , 500-502 (1989), held that the protections required to be accorded juveniles could not be satisfied if the ""advisor"" (the defendant's sister) was herself a minor, thirteen days shy of her eighteenth birthday. The court noted that, even if the sister had been eighteen, the court had ""serious reservations about whether the evidence presented at the suppression hearing, including [the sister's] testimony that she 'understood' the Miranda warnings, was enough to demonstrate that [the sister's] understanding was adequate to qualify her to advise the
Page 292
defendant about so crucial a question as whether he should relinquish his constitutional rights to remain silent and have counsel."" Id. at 502 n.1.
Here, the juvenile's mother was not even made aware of her son's interrogation, let alone ""informed of and made to understand"" the juvenile's constitutional rights the Commonwealth claims were waived.
Implicit in Commonwealth v. Berry, 410 Mass. at 35, Commonwealth v. Hogan, 426 Mass. at 430, and Commonwealth v. McCra, 427 Mass. at 566, is the assumption that the interested adult will be present at the interrogation area if not at the interrogation itself. [Note 14] See generally Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure § 372 (2d. ed. 1983 & 2001 Supp.). Such presence is surely the favored practice and should be facilitated by the Commonwealth. [Note 15] We are buttressed in this conclusion by the policy expressed in G. L. c. 119, § 67, which requires the ""immediate"" notification of a parent by the police ""whenever a child between seven and seventeen is arrested,"" and authorizes the police officer in charge of the police station to ""inquire into the case."" By providing that ""[p]ending such notice and inquiry, such child shall be detained,"" the statute indicates that questioning
Page 293
should not proceed until such notification has taken place. While we have not considered whether the lengthy detention of the juvenile was in effect an arrest, we see no reason why the policy considerations of § 67 should not here apply. See Commonwealth v. Wallace, 346 Mass. 9 , 17 (1963) (violation of G. L. c. 119, § 67, accompanied by lengthy questioning by police, an important factor in determining whether a confession or admission is voluntary.)
Moreover, a juvenile in trouble may be embarrassed to ask for an adult's help, and this may have been the case here, as the juvenile heard the older youth reject his mother's presence. Where, as here, the juvenile was detained for two and one-half hours in circumstances in which his mother and other close relatives were available but were not even informed of his detention, the mere asking the juvenile by the police whether he wanted his mother to be brought to him so that he might consult with her did not, we conclude, provide the juvenile with an adequate opportunity to consult.
Nor is the Commonwealth correct that its offer to let the juvenile speak with one of the adults in the apartment was sufficient. There is no basis in the record to conclude that any of the adults present in the apartment qualified as an adult who was informed of and understood the juvenile's rights. The only adult as to whom there was evidence that she was even known by the defendant was Charlotte Cahill, McMann's mother. No special relationship of the juvenile to Cahill was shown.
Our cases involving ""interested adults"" have all involved parents or other relatives. Indeed, in Commonwealth v. McCra, 427 Mass. at 568, the requirement was characterized as ""an opportunity for a meaningful consultation with a parent, or an adult acting in loco parentis."" At the very least, the adult should be someone who can be considered ""interested in the defendant's welfare."" See id. at 569.
The Commonwealth argues that even should we determine (as we have) that the juvenile did not have the opportunity to consult with an interested adult, the alternative allowed by Commonwealth v. A Juvenile, 389 Mass. at 134, applies, namely, the circumstances show the juvenile had the necessary ""high
Page 294
degree of intelligence, experience, knowledge or sophistication"" to waive his Miranda rights.
Because of the motion judge's decision that the Commonwealth had satisfied the first alternative, the opportunity to consult with an interested adult, the judge did not discuss the second question. However, as in Commonwealth v. A Juvenile, 402 Mass. 275 , 280 (1988), ""the omission is not crucial here because there is no evidence in the record that would have warranted"" such a finding. The only evidence the Commonwealth points to is the juvenile's statement to the police that he understood the Miranda warnings because he had been arrested twice before, once for a robbery. [Note 16] His previous arrests standing alone do not give him the required knowledge or sophistication. See Commonwealth v. Guyton, 405 Mass. at 503, where the court stated: [Note 17]
""The judge's finding that . . . the defendant had 'extensive contact with the police and juvenile authorities and was well aware of his Miranda rights,' even if it were warranted by the evidence at the suppression hearing, does not satisfy [the second alternative of Commonwealth v. A Juvenile, 389 Mass. at 134]. Extensive contact with the police and other authorities by itself does not demonstrate unusual sophistication or knowledge about the Miranda rights."" [Note 18]
Proceeding with the ""special caution"" where a juvenile's waiver of constitutional rights is involved, see Commonwealth v. Cain, 361 Mass. 224 , 228 (1972), we conclude that the motion to suppress the juvenile's statements should have been allowed.
Page 295
In view of our conclusion that both motions to suppress were erroneously denied, the adjudications of delinquency are reversed, and the verdicts are set aside. [Note 19] The case is remanded to the Juvenile Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

COMMONWEALTH vs. THOMAS J. O'DAY,"Further appellate review granted, 439 Mass. 1101 (2003).
Search and Seizure, Warrant, Probable cause.
The evidence before the magistrate who issued a warrant to search a defendant's house did not constitute a substantial basis to believe that there were drugs in the defendant's house, and therefore, the judge at the defendant's criminal trial should have allowed the defendant's motion to suppress evidence seized as a result of the search, where the connection between the defendant's drug-dealing activities at his place of work and his house was limited to the facts that the defendant lived at the address, that on two occasions he drove directly from home to work where he sold cocaine, and that some undetermined number of cars made brief visits to the address during surveillance conducted on two nights three weeks apart. [836-840]
INDICTMENTS found and returned in the Superior Court Department on January 16, 1998.
A pretrial motion to suppress evidence was heard by Richard J. Chin, J.; a motion to dismiss was heard by Mitchell J. Sikora, Jr., J.; and the cases were tried before John A. Tierney, J.
Nona E. Walker, Committee for Public Counsel Services, for the defendant.
John E. Bradley, Assistant District Attorney, for the Commonwealth.","BECK, J. The defendant appeals from the denial of his motion to suppress evidence seized in a search of his home. He also claims error in the denial of his motion to dismiss an indictment for possession of an infernal machine (a grenade simulator) found in his bedroom during the search. Although the warrant authorized a search for ""controlled substances"" and related equipment and records, the only charge on which the defendant was found guilty was possession of the grenade simulator. He
Page 834
was acquitted of possession of cocaine and of a firearm. The issue on appeal is whether there was probable cause to support the warrant.
1. Factual background. There is no dispute that there was probable cause to believe that the defendant was dealing drugs at DJ's pub in Brockton, where he was the doorman. As set out in the affidavit of an experienced State trooper, the facts are as follows. An informant told the police he bought cocaine from the defendant and another man at DJ's pub and that the men kept the cocaine ""on their person."" He also reported that the other man lived in an apartment over the pub. According to the informant, the defendant supplied ""other Hispanic and young black males with cocaine for distribution.""
In response to the informant's information, the State police set up surveillance inside and outside the pub. On several occasions they observed men in the pub who were not drinking, but were pacing back and forth, looking out the front door. As soon as the defendant arrived, the men approached him, had what appeared to be brief conversations with him, walked into the men's room with him, and then left the pub as soon as they emerged from the men's room. On other occasions the defendant appeared to conduct transactions literally under the table. Three controlled buys, two in the men's room and one under the table, were sufficient to corroborate the informant's statements that the defendant was selling cocaine at the pub. See Commonwealth v. Villella, 39 Mass. App. Ct. 426 , 427 (1995).
On two occasions the police engaged in surveillance of the defendant's house at 10 Hunt Street in Brockton. (The informant had not provided any information about that location.) When the police arrived for the first surveillance at 7:00 P.M. on October 9, 1997, they saw cars parked in the driveway and on the street in front of the defendant's house. At 7:30 P.M., a white Ford Bronco sport utility vehicle registered to Catherine Livargo of an address in East Bridgewater pulled up in front of the house. Livargo was known to be the defendant's girlfriend. The affiant stated that he saw ""other vehicles"" also pull up in front of 10 Hunt Street. ""After a brief stay these vehicles and their occupants departed [the] location."" The defendant and his girlfriend emerged from the house about 8:00 P.M. and embraced.
Page 835
The girlfriend left in the white Bronco. The defendant left at 8:13 P.M. in a blue Ford pickup truck, also registered to his girlfriend, and drove directly to the pub. (The electrical service to the house was also in the girlfriend's name.) At the pub the defendant engaged in what appeared to be two under-the-table transactions, one with a Hispanic man the surveillance officers had seen two weeks before, and the other in the second of the controlled buys. After the transaction involving him, the Hispanic man went up a flight of stairs leading to the apartments above the bar.
Three weeks later, the police conducted a second surveillance at 10 Hunt Street, again beginning at 7:00 P.M. The officers ""made note of several vehicles that arrived and departed [the defendant's] residence after a brief stay."" Again the girlfriend arrived after 7:00 P.M. and left before 8:00 P.M. The defendant left at 8:04 P.M., again in the blue pickup, and again drove directly to the pub. There was another controlled buy, this time in the men's room. On this evening, the affiant also saw the defendant leave the pub several times for brief conversations on a wireless telephone. At one point the defendant appeared to retrieve something from the blue pickup truck, which was parked across the street.
On the basis of the evidence set out above, a magistrate issued a search warrant for 10 Hunt Street. The search uncovered a grenade simulator in the bureau in the defendant's bedroom, and 1.64 grams of cocaine and a revolver in a black padlocked box hidden in the ceiling area of the basement.
2. The motion to suppress. In summarizing the basis for his request for a warrant to search the defendant's house, the State trooper noted the motor vehicle traffic at the house (which he termed ""consistent with narcotics distribution"") and the fact that the defendant appeared to have ""a quantity of cocaine on his person readily available for sale."" The trooper expressed the opinion that ""a quantity of cocaine is carried from [the defendant's] residence in his vehicle to his place of work. While at work, as his supply of cocaine diminishes, [the defendant] replenishes same by a stash that he maintains in his truck.""
In denying the defendant's motion to suppress, the motion judge found that ""[o]n most occasions, suspected drug activity
Page 836
confirmed by surveillance of any kind warrants a reasonable belief that a residence may be connected to some sort of criminal activity,"" citing Commonwealth v. DiStefano, 22 Mass. App. Ct. 535 , 540 (1986). He further noted that ""it is proper to infer that a drug dealer would keep drugs that he may be dealing within his home,"" citing United States v. Gant, 759 F.2d 484, 488 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 851 (1985), and Commonwealth v. Singer, 29 Mass. App. Ct. 708 , 715 (1991) (disapproved on other grounds in Commonwealth v. Ramirez, 416 Mass. 41 , 53 n.19 [1993]). Relying on the fact that the police saw ""a high incidence of 'come and go' traffic from the defendant's residence,"" the judge concluded that ""[t]his type of behavior is consistent with narcotics distribution."" He ruled that ""[i]t was proper for the police to believe that the defendant was keeping controlled substances within his home since he went directly from home to work on the nights that the drug transactions were observed.""
a. Governing legal principles. In reviewing a motion to suppress, we accept the judge's findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous, but we conduct a de novo review of his conclusions of law. Commonwealth v. James, 427 Mass. 312 , 314 (1998). ""The standard for probable cause is 'whether [the magistrate] has a substantial basis for concluding that any of the articles described in the warrant are probably in the place to be searched . . . . Strong reason to suspect is not adequate.' "" Commonwealth v. Olivares, 30 Mass. App. Ct. 596 , 600 (1991), quoting from Commonwealth v. Upton, 394 Mass. 363 , 370 (1985). ""The establishment of probable cause to believe that 'a person is guilty of a crime does not necessarily constitute probable cause to search the person's residence.' . . . The connection between the items to be seized and the place to be searched . . . may be found by looking at the type of crime, nature of the items, the suspect's opportunity to conceal items, and inferences as to where the items are likely to be hidden."" (Citation omitted.) Commonwealth v. Olivares, 30 Mass. App. Ct. at 600.
b. Discussion. As he did below, the defendant contends that two of the motion judge's findings of fact are unsupported by the record: (1) that there was a ""high incidence of 'come and go'
Page 837
traffic"" at his house; and (2) that the defendant had a lengthy criminal record. A review of the affidavit confirms that the affiant did not use the words ""high incidence of 'come and go' traffic"" or ""steady flow of 'come and go' traffic"" as the judge did in describing what the police observed during their surveillance of the defendant's house. As to the first surveillance, the affidavit sets forth that after the girlfriend arrived, the police saw ""other vehicles . . . pull up in front of this address and subjects walk into [the defendant's] residence [and a]fter a brief stay these vehicles and their occupants departed this location."" On the second surveillance, the affiant reported that ""several vehicles . . . arrived and departed [the defendant's] residence after a brief stay."" We agree that ""other vehicles"" and ""several vehicles"" do not constitute ""a high incidence"" or ""steady flow"" of come and go traffic. We therefore disregard the judge's description in our analysis of the probable cause issue. As to the extent of the defendant's criminal record, that issue has no relevance to the nexus between the defendant's house and his narcotics activity.
Having highlighted these factual errors, the defendant argues that the motion judge erred in concluding that the magistrate had a sufficient basis for issuing the warrant to search the house. As the defendant points out, the cases on which the judge relied are distinguishable on their facts. In Commonwealth v. Singer, 29 Mass. App. Ct. at 710, the police had informant information that the defendant was selling drugs from the apartment to be searched, and at least some of the people seen entering the apartment were known to be involved in cocaine dealing. Such is not the case here. There is no indication that the informant ever mentioned the defendant's residence, the sale of drugs from that location, or the girlfriend. Moreover, whatever their number, none of those who paid a brief visit to the defendant's house was identified as having any connection with narcotics or their distribution.
In Commonwealth v. DiStefano, 22 Mass. App. Ct. at 537-538, which the judge also cited, the informant said he had accompanied a friend to the defendants' home to buy heroin and surveillance officers saw a known drug dealer enter the defendants' house with a small package. United States v. Gant,
Page 838
759 F.2d 484 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 851 (1985), was not decided on probable cause grounds, but instead relied upon the Supreme Court's good faith exception to the exclusionary rule, as set out in United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897 (1984). That is not an issue here. Cf. Commonwealth v. Pellegrini, 405 Mass. 86 , 91 n.6, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 975 (1989) (noting that Massachusetts has not adopted good faith doctrine of United States v. Leon); Commonwealth v. Hecox, 35 Mass. App. Ct. 277 , 282 n.6 (1993) (same).
The motion judge also relied on Commonwealth v. Cinelli, 389 Mass. 197 , cert. denied, 464 U.S. 860 (1983). However, that case involved a search for the ""fruits and instrumentalities"" of an armed robbery and the shooting of a police officer -- clothes, money, weapons, and ammunition. Id. at 214 n.16. Since the nature of the crime and the items being sought are relevant factors in determining probable cause, see Commonwealth v. Olivares, 30 Mass. App. Ct. at 600, and given the extensive case law of search and seizure involving narcotics, we shall focus on those cases.
As the defendant argues, cases finding a sufficient nexus between the contraband sought and the place to be searched generally involve a more direct connection between the two than is the case here. For example, in Commonwealth v. Hall, 366 Mass. 790 , 797-798 (1975), an informant provided a reliable tip that drugs were available in the second-floor apartment at a particular address. In Commonwealth v. Parapar, 404 Mass. 319 , 320-321 (1989), the informants supplied detailed information about activities at the place to be searched, where police had observed ""numerous"" people entering and leaving the apartment. See Commonwealth v. Blake, 413 Mass. 823 , 828-829 (1992) (informant information that defendant was selling large amounts of drugs from his apartment corroborated by controlled buy, for which defendant left his house and drove directly to point of sale); Commonwealth v. DiStefano, 22 Mass. App. Ct. at 538-539 (police observed known drug dealer arrive at address, stay for thirty minutes, and then reenter carrying package from his car; others also seen visiting house including repeat visit from same known dealer and another identifiable drug offender); Commonwealth v. Soto, 35 Mass. App. Ct. 340 ,
Page 839
344 (1993) (officers observed numerous suspicious short visits to apartment at precise time when informant told officer that cocaine would be ready); Commonwealth v. Watson, 36 Mass. App. Ct. 252 , 254-255 (1994) (informant's tip that cocaine was for sale at particular address corroborated by observation of cars double parked and people running inside and leaving within a few minutes); Commonwealth v. Alcantara, 53 Mass. App. Ct. 591 , 593-594 (2002) (sufficient nexus established where defendant was known to deliver cocaine at place of his choosing away from his apartment; confidential informant arranged to meet defendant for drug transaction, defendant was observed leaving address, defendant delivered drugs to informant, and defendant returned directly home). Contrast Commonwealth v. Kaufman, 381 Mass. 301 , 304 (1980) (finding particular details lacking to connect address to drug sales despite observation of ""unknown male carrying into . . . target premises several plastic bags allegedly 'consistent' in size and shape with bags commonly used to transport large amounts of marihuana"" and despite undercover agent's report that drugs were kept in house).
Recently we have reversed the denial of motions to suppress for want of sufficient nexus between the activities at issue and the defendant's residence. In Commonwealth v. Hill, 51 Mass. App. Ct. 598 (2001), the police had received anonymous information about drug dealing in the apartment, but there were no observations of actual drug deals, and no information about the less than ten unknown individuals seen making short visits to the two-story duplex, apparently over a two-week period, except for one who was a known drug dealer and user. We termed the visits to the apartment ""minimal foot traffic,"" id. at 607, and concluded the evidence in that case did not constitute adequate corroboration of anonymous tips. Id. at 607-609. In Commonwealth v. Chongarlides, 52 Mass. App. Ct. 366 , 369-372 (2001), a case involving a search for heroin in connection with a death, we concluded that the motion to suppress was properly allowed because there was no basis to believe the heroin would be found at the defendant's house in view of the fact that the ingestion had taken place elsewhere. See Commonwealth v. Olivares, 30 Mass. App. Ct. at 597, 600- 601 (no specific information in affidavit tying defendant's residence to
Page 840
drug sales except observation of defendant departing from house just before arriving to execute controlled buy). See also Commonwealth v. Gauthier, 425 Mass. 37 , 40-41 (1997) (reliability of informant established, but nothing pointed to defendant's residence as place of supply). We do not find the Federal cases the Commonwealth cites in support of its argument persuasive.
Although the question is close, we conclude that probable cause to believe there were drugs at the defendant's house was lacking. We are mindful that the magistrate's determination of probable cause is due great deference. Commonwealth v. Upton, 394 Mass. at 377. On the other hand, ""[p]hysical entry of the home is the chief evil against which the wording of the Fourth Amendment is directed."" Commonwealth v. Skea, 18 Mass. App. Ct. 685 , 696 (1984), quoting from Welsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U.S. 740, 748 (1984). The evidence of a connection between the defendant's activities at the pub and his house was limited to the facts that the defendant lived at the address, that on two occasions he drove directly from home to work where he sold cocaine, and that some undetermined number of cars (""other vehicles"" and ""several vehicles"") made brief visits to the address during surveillance conducted on two occasions three weeks apart. The informant who brought the defendant to the attention of the police did not allege that the defendant was distributing cocaine from his house; indeed, he did not mention the defendant's house at all. Nor did anyone see the defendant, his girlfriend, or any of the visitors carrying anything at any time while they were under surveillance. None of those observed during the surveillance of the defendant's house was identified as having any connection with the use or distribution of narcotics. In sum, the evidence before the magistrate did not constitute a ""substantial basis,"" see Commonwealth v. Upton, supra at 370, to believe there were drugs in the defendant's home. The motion to suppress should have been allowed. Having concluded that the evidence seized from the defendant's house should be suppressed for want of probable cause, we

Judgment for defendant.","April 12, 2002 - December 24, 2002",
COMMONWEALTH vs. ROSE M.,"Controlled Substances. Practice, Criminal, Argument by prosecutor. Evidence, Informer.
At the trial of indictments charging the possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute, the judge did not err in denying the defendant's motions for required findings of not guilty where, despite the defendant's claims that she did not know of the cocaine's presence in a key case located under the bar counter at which she was seated, the jury reasonably could have inferred from the evidence presented that the defendant in fact had constructive possession of the cocaine. [870-871]
At the trial of indictments charging the possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute, the prosecutor's suggestion to the jury during closing argument that the police had received a tip from an informant or other information that the defendant was selling drugs before they entered the lounge in which they discovered cocaine immediately in front of where the defendant was seated, although out of the defendant's sight, was improper and, in the circumstances of this case, created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, in that the improper argument could well have influenced the jury's verdict.

The defendant was found guilty by a jury of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute (G. L. c. 94C, § 32A[c]), possession of cocaine with intent to distribute in a school zone (G. L. c. 94C, § 32J), and, after a bench trial, of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, second offense (G. L. c. 94C, § 32A[d]).
Page 868
On appeal, the defendant claims error in the judge's denial of her motion for a required finding of not guilty and in the prosecutor's closing argument. She also claims that her counsel was ineffective in failing to request an instruction on the lesser included offense of possession of cocaine. Because the prosecutor impermissibly alluded to certain hearsay statements that the judge had excluded from evidence, we reverse.
Background. The Commonwealth's evidence was as follows. On May 2, 2000, at approximately 4:30 P.M., Springfield police Officer Felix Aguirre, dressed in plain clothes and acting at the direction of another Springfield police officer, Steven Kent, walked into a bar in Springfield known as the My Place Lounge to buy cocaine. Officer Aguirre previously had purchased cocaine there on numerous occasions.
When Officer Aguirre entered the lounge, fewer than ten people were inside. They included the defendant and an employee of the lounge, Barbara Rattelle, who were sitting in the rear of the lounge, at the end of a circular bar. Officer Aguirre walked directly up to the defendant and asked her for a ""twenty."" The defendant, after looking him up and down, responded, ""I don't think so. I don't know you."" Officer Aguirre then left the lounge and joined other officers outside who were conducting surveillance of the lounge.
A short time later, the defendant came out of the lounge, went across the street to a restaurant, and returned with a bag of food. At this point, other police officers, including Pedro Soler and Joselito Lozada, entered the lounge and found the defendant sitting in the same seat at the bar she had previously occupied.
After obtaining the defendant's consent, Officer Lozada searched the defendant's purse but did not find any drugs. Officer Soler then instructed the defendant to get up from her chair and, after conducting a search of the area, found a magnetic key case under the counter top directly in front of where the defendant had been sitting. The key case contained thirty-five individually wrapped rocks of cocaine.
At trial, the defendant moved in limine to prevent the Commonwealth from presenting any evidence that the police had been acting on a tip from an informant in entering the lounge. The judge allowed this motion, ruling that Officer Aguirre could
Page 869
testify only to ""[w]hat he did,"" and not to any information he had received.
Officers Kent, Aguirre, Soler, and Lozada testified at trial. During Officer Kent's testimony, the prosecutor attempted to elicit that he had instructed Officer Aguirre to seek out the defendant at the lounge but the defendant objected and the judge sustained the objection.
Subsequently, during Officer Aguirre's testimony, the prosecutor attempted to elicit that Officer Aguirre had entered the lounge intending to approach the defendant and no one else. The defendant objected to this testimony, the judge sustained the objection, and during a subsequent bench conference, the judge reiterated that he had excluded any reference to any informant's tip. In addition, the judge specifically admonished the prosecutor not to place the informant's tip before the jury through the ""back door"" by bringing out the specific instructions Officer Aguirre had received before he entered the lounge.
Thereafter, Officer Lozada testified that, prior to entering the lounge, he had been conducting surveillance from across the street and had seen the defendant, whom he recognized by name, emerge and go to a restaurant. When defense counsel asked him during cross-examination who had first mentioned the defendant's name to him, Officer Lozada responded that Officer Kent had mentioned the defendant's name earlier that evening before he had gone to the lounge. The prosecutor then attempted on redirect to elicit that Officer Kent had instructed Officer Lozada to look for particular items when he went to the lounge but, once again, the defendant objected and the judge sustained the defendant's objection.
The defendant testified and denied that she had any knowledge that the key case was located under the bar counter or that it contained cocaine. She also denied that she had made the statement attributed to her by Officer Aguirre. She further stated that a Hispanic male had in fact approached her and asked for ""coke,"" but she had responded only that he had the wrong person.
Rattelle and another person employed at the lounge, Karen Pietras, also appeared as witnesses for the defendant. Rattelle testified that the police had searched for twenty or thirty minutes
Page 870
before finding the magnetic key case under the bar counter. Pietras testified that she had seen the defendant enter the lounge at about 4:30 P.M. on the evening in question, but had not seen her place anything under the bar counter.
1. Motion for required finding of not guilty. The defendant claims that the judge erred in denying her motion for a required finding of not guilty because the evidence introduced at trial was sufficient to show only that she was present at the bar where the cocaine was discovered, but was insufficient to show either that she knew that the cocaine was present or that she had the power and intent to exercise control over the cocaine. The essential elements of a showing of constructive possession, namely, knowledge, power, and intent to exercise control over the illicit substance, see Commonwealth v. Carmenatty, 37 Mass. App. Ct. 908 , 909 (1994), may be shown by ""presence, supplemented by other incriminating evidence."" Commonwealth v. Brzezinski, 405 Mass. 401 , 410 (1989), quoting from Commonwealth v. Albano, 373 Mass. 132 , 134 (1977). Here, there was evidence that the defendant was sitting not just near the cocaine under the bar, but rather right in front of it. There was also evidence that, when Officer Aguirre approached the defendant and asked for a ""twenty,"" [Note 1] the defendant refused his request only because she did not know him, and not for any other reason.
The jury could reasonably infer from this evidence that the defendant in fact had constructive possession of the cocaine. See Commonwealth v. Gonzalez, 42 Mass. App. Ct. 235 , 237-241 (1997). See also Commonwealth v. Altenhaus, 317 Mass. 270 , 273 (1944) (knowledge ""may be, and generally is, proved by circumstantial evidence; and it may be inferred from a great variety of circumstances""). While the defendant testified that her conversation with Officer Aguirre was substantially different from what he had described, the jury were not required to credit this testimony but could instead conclude that Officer Aguirre's account of the conversation was accurate and showed that the defendant in fact had the requisite knowledge, power, and intent
Page 871
to exercise control over the cocaine that was present. See Commonwealth v. Plouffe, 52 Mass. App. Ct. 543 , 545 (2001).
2. Improper closing argument. The prosecutor began his closing argument by stating:
""Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, [defense counsel] spoke to you at some length about coincidence. I'm going to talk to you about that a little later.""
Then, a short time later, the prosecutor stated:
""Which gets me back to the issue of the coincidence. Ask yourself, was it a coincidence on May 2 of the year 2000 that an undercover police officer at five o'clock in the afternoon goes to My Place Lounge? Is it a coincidence that he enters the My Place Lounge and by all estimates there [are] six to ten people there? Is it a coincidence that he doesn't go to anyone else at the bar but goes directly to Rose Monson? Is it a coincidence that the undercover officer asked Ms. Monson for a twenty?""
A little later, after arguing that the defendant had carefully looked Officer Aguirre over before refusing his request for a ""twenty,"" the prosecutor stated:
""Now, next I would like . . . you to ask yourself, is it a coincidence -- or shortly thereafter, as soon as Ms. Monson comes back from the Chinese restaurant, is it a coincidence that the officers went back into My Place Lounge, and is it a coincidence they don't go anyplace else except for Ms. Monson?
""The officers went there for one purpose. That is to search and locate narcotics. And where do they locate them? They didn't locate them anyplace else except for exactly where Ms. Monson was hiding them, exactly where they were stored.""
The defendant contends that these statements were improper because they strongly implied to the jury that the police had received a tip from an informant or other information that the defendant was selling cocaine before Officer Aguirre had entered the lounge to buy such cocaine, notwithstanding the judge's prior allowance of the defendant's motion in limine to exclude
Page 872
any reference to any such information. The defendant further contends that, even though she did not object to the prosecutor's argument, it created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice, and hence, reversal of her convictions is required. See Commonwealth v. Freeman, 352 Mass. 556 , 563-564 (1967).
We agree with the defendant that the prosecutor's statements were improper. The judge had ruled no less than four separate times that the Commonwealth was barred from presenting any evidence that, when he entered the lounge and attempted to purchase cocaine from the defendant, Officer Aguirre was acting on a tip from an informant or other information the police had received. See Commonwealth v. Rosario, 430 Mass. 505 , 509-510 (1999) (discussing need for strict control of any such evidence even where necessary to show state of police knowledge). Notwithstanding these repeated rulings, the prosecutor, by urging the jury to consider that it was not just a coincidence that Officer Aguirre had approached the defendant and asked for a twenty, rather than any of the other persons in the lounge, strongly implied that Officer Aguirre was in fact acting on a tip from an informant or other information the police had received when he entered the lounge and attempted to purchase a twenty from the defendant. This was improper in view of the judge's prior rulings. [Note 2] See Commonwealth v. Burke, 373 Mass. 569 , 575 (1977); Commonwealth v. Mosby, 11 Mass. App. Ct. 1 , 9 (1980); Commonwealth v. O'Brien, 56 Mass. App. Ct. 170 (2002). See also Commonwealth v. Kater, 388 Mass. 519 , 533 (1983).
Page 873
We also conclude that, in the circumstances of this case, the improper argument created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. ""An error creates a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice unless we are persuaded that it did not 'materially influence[]' the guilty verdict."" Commonwealth v Alphas, 430 Mass. 8 , 13 (1999), quoting from Commonwealth v. Freeman, supra at 564.
Here, the Commonwealth's evidence against the defendant was far from overwhelming. While the cocaine was discovered immediately in front of where the defendant was sitting, it was hidden underneath the bar counter out of the defendant's sight, and there were several other people in the lounge who might have placed it there. Moreover, the defendant denied that she had made the statements attributed to her by Officer Aguirre, which themselves were less than an explicit admission that she possessed the cocaine that was hidden under the bar counter. In these circumstances, the prosecutor's improper suggestion that the police had received a tip from an informant or other information that the defendant was selling drugs before they entered the lounge could well have influenced the jury's verdict.
In light of the foregoing, the judgments are reversed and the finding and verdicts are set aside. [Note 3]

John L. Daly, Jr., for the defendant.","ARMSTRONG, C.J. On May 3, 2002, Leominster police executed search warrants for the defendant Charles Hardy's vehicle and apartment residence. Both warrants authorized a search of the defendant. From the defendant's person, police seized 267 grams of cocaine and $940 in a tape-wrapped package, a cellular telephone, and a police baton. From his vehicle, police recovered a glassine bag containing over two grams of cocaine. From the apartment, police seized an electronic scale with white powder residue, a small amount of marijuana, baggies with
Page 211
white powder residue, a sifter with white powder residue, a shotgun shell, and various martial arts weapons.
Following his indictment on charges of trafficking in cocaine and possession of a Class D controlled substance (marijuana), the defendant moved to suppress the evidence seized from his vehicle and his apartment pursuant to the search warrants. A Superior Court judge concluded that the affidavit submitted in support of the search warrant applications [Note 1] furnished probable cause to search the vehicle but not the apartment, and he suppressed the evidence seized from the apartment. [Note 2] A single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court granted the Commonwealth's application for leave to prosecute an interlocutory appeal of the suppression order and transferred the case to this court. We reverse the order suppressing the evidence seized from the apartment.
Our inquiry as to the sufficiency of a search warrant application begins and ends with the ""four corners of the affidavit."" Commonwealth v. O'Day, 440 Mass. 296 , 297 (2003), quoting from Commonwealth v. Villella, 39 Mass. App. Ct. 426 , 428 (1995). Detective Joseph Siciliano, Jr., a member of the Leominster police drug enforcement unit, submitted the affidavit, which contained the following information. A confidential informant told police that a white male named Charles Hardy, called ""Chuck,"" who lived in apartment 3 of the Coolidge building at 740 Central Street, Leominster, was selling cocaine at various locations within Leominster and Clinton. The informant described the defendant's vehicle: a gray Nissan pickup truck, license plate number E18198. The informant also stated that the defendant stored cocaine in his apartment. The informant previously had provided information that led to the 1997 drug trafficking conviction of a named individual.
The Leominster police used the informant to make two
Page 212
controlled purchases from the defendant. During each controlled purchase, police observed the defendant leave the Coolidge building at 740 Central Street, enter the gray Nissan pickup, and drive directly to the informant's location. After the first controlled buy, the defendant returned to the Coolidge building and entered a first-floor apartment the police later confirmed was apartment 3.
Detective Siciliano also conducted independent surveillance of the defendant over a month-long period. During this period, he observed the defendant leave the Coolidge building, drive the gray Nissan pickup to locations in Clinton and Leominster, meet briefly with individuals, exchange items, and leave. Detective Siciliano stated in the affidavit that in his experience, this activity was ""common in the illegal distribution of controlled substances.""
Detective Siciliano observed the defendant returning to the Coolidge building and entering apartment 3 on other occasions. Employees of the Coolidge building confirmed that the defendant drove a gray Nissan pickup and lived in apartment 3.
To establish probable cause for a search warrant, an affidavit must ""contain enough information for the issuing magistrate to determine that the items sought are related to the criminal activity under investigation, and that they may reasonably be expected to be located in the place to be searched."" Commonwealth v. O'Day, 440 Mass. at 300, quoting from Commonwealth v. Cefalo, 381 Mass. 319 , 328 (1980). ""[T]he affidavit should be read as a whole, not parsed, severed, and subjected to hypercritical analysis."" Commonwealth v. Blake, 413 Mass. 823 , 827 (1992). The information provided by the informant and the independent observations of the Leominster police established a sufficient nexus between the defendant's drug-dealing activity and his residence to justify a search. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Saleh, 396 Mass. 406 , 411-412 (1985); Commonwealth v. O'Day, 440 Mass. at 302.
In each of the two controlled buys, the defendant drove directly from his residence to the designated location and conducted a drug transaction. On numerous other occasions, police observed the defendant leave his apartment, drive to locations in Clinton and Leominster, and engage in what appeared
Page 213
to be drug transactions. Because the defendant was under constant surveillance, it was unlikely that he obtained the drugs from a location other than his home. Commonwealth v. O'Day, 440 Mass. at 303.
A magistrate may draw "" 'normal inferences as to where a criminal would be likely to hide' the drugs he sells."" Id. at 302, quoting from Commonwealth v. Cinelli, 389 Mass. 197 , 213, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 860 (1983). Although the fact that an individual on one occasion drives directly from his residence to a drug transaction does not, by itself, establish probable cause to search his residence, see Commonwealth v. Smith, 57 Mass. App. Ct. 907 , 908 (2003), it may, with additional evidence -- police observations, for example -- link a defendant's drug-selling activity to his residence. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Blake, 413 Mass. at 829; Commonwealth v. O'Day, 440 Mass. at 303. The defendant's pattern of driving directly from his home to drug transactions distinguishes this case from the Smith case, where we held that a single observation of a defendant driving from his residence to a drug transaction did not supply probable cause to search the home. Commonwealth v. Smith, 57 Mass. App. Ct. at 908.
The magistrate could infer from the fact that the defendant engaged in multiple transactions during a single trip that he was carrying a large amount of drugs. See Commonwealth v. O'Day, 440 Mass. at 303. Here, as in O'Day, it was unlikely that the defendant would store large quantities of drugs in his truck while he was at home; and although the defendant was never observed carrying anything from his truck into his house, valuable quantities of cocaine are easily concealed on one's person. Ibid. The fact that police never observed short-term visitors or other evidence of drug transactions at the defendant's residence, as in Commonwealth v. O'Day, supra at 302, is not fatal to probable cause, because the defendant's usual method of operation was to deliver drugs away from his apartment. See Commonwealth v. Alcantara, 53 Mass. App. Ct. 591 , 594 (2002).
It was true, as the judge observed, that the confidential informant -- so far as the affidavit related -- did not state that he had visited apartment 3 and seen drugs there, and thus did not disclose his basis for stating that the defendant kept drugs in
Page 214
his apartment. But the police surveillance of the defendant's movements, sufficiently confirming that his apartment was the base for his operations, brought the case within the principle that a tip, ""even though not [by itself] qualifying under Aguilar [v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108 (1964)], may be used to give such additional color as is needed to elevate the information acquired by police observation above the floor required for probable cause."" Commonwealth v. Saleh, 396 Mass. at 411, quoting from United States v. Canieso, 470 F.2d 1224, 1231 (2d Cir. 1972). Because of the police observations, this is not a case where ""there was no specific information in the affidavit which tied the defendant's residence to illegal drug transactions, other than that he lived at those premises."" Commonwealth v. Chongarlides, 52 Mass. App. Ct. 366 , 370 (2001), quoting from Commonwealth v. Olivares, 30 Mass. App. Ct. 596 , 600 (1991). Rather, this case is controlled by Commonwealth v. O'Day, supra.

This court concluded that a warrantless entry by police officers into a criminal defendant's dwelling, done for the purpose of impounding the premises while a search warrant was being sought, was not constitutionally permissible, where, even assuming that the police had probable cause to believe that the defendant was distributing cocaine that was located on the premises, there was no specific information supporting an objectively reasonable belief on the part of the police, prior to the time they approached the premises, that evidence would be removed or destroyed unless preventative measures were taken [470-475], and the police did not, under the circumstances, obtain justification for their warrantless entry through announcing their presence to the defendant at his door [475-477]; therefore, while a District Court judge erred in denying the defendant's motion to suppress evidence, at least with respect to certain items seized during the impoundment and the defendant's statement at the time of his arrest [479], cash and plastic baggies seized at the dwelling during the later execution of a validly issued search warrant could properly be admitted in evidence pursuant to the independent source rule [477-478], and a handgun seized in plain view during the impoundment was admissible under the inevitable discovery rule [479-481].

Gregory H. Matthews, Assistant District Attorney, for the Commonwealth.","DOERFER, J. Before us is the defendant's interlocutory appeal from the denial of his motion to suppress evidence obtained after the police made a warrantless entry into his dwelling to impound the premises while a search warrant was sought. Broadly put, the issues raised here concern whether the warrantless intrusion was constitutionally permissible and, if not, whether the independent source or inevitable discovery rules nonetheless rendered the evidence admissible. The motion judge held evidentiary hearings and made written findings of fact and rulings of law. We begin by summarizing the explicit findings and the undisputed evidence.
Background. During January and February, 2002, the Woburn police conducted an investigation of the defendant, whom they suspected of dealing drugs from a dwelling at 88 Creston Avenue in Woburn. They had focused on a man named Patrick Mallon when they learned from a confidential informant (CI) in early January, 2002, that Mallon was buying crack cocaine from a man named ""Steve"" at 88 Creston Avenue. On January 14, 2002, the police arranged to make a controlled buy of cocaine through Mallon using the CI. First the police searched the CI and found he had no cocaine. They then surveilled the CI, who met with Mallon and a woman named Robin Berry. The police followed the three as they drove together to 88 Creston Avenue. The officers observed Mallon leave the vehicle, enter 88 Creston Avenue, emerge a short time later, and reenter the vehicle. The vehicle was followed back to a predetermined location, where the CI produced to police four grams of cocaine. The CI reported that he bought the cocaine from Mallon after Mallon had obtained it from Steve at 88 Creston Avenue.
During the first week of February, 2002, the police spoke with Berry and Mallon. Berry told them that she had been buying cocaine with Mallon for six months, that she purchased cocaine at 88 Creston Avenue, and that she had gone there to buy cocaine with the CI and Mallon on January 14, 2002. Mallon told them that he had been buying cocaine from Steve for six months, that the modus operandi was to page Steve and then
Page 469
go to the rear door on the first floor of 88 Creston Avenue, and that he would wait in the kitchen while Steve went upstairs to get the cocaine. Mallon confirmed the January 14, 2002, transaction.
The investigation culminated when police observed, during a surveillance of 88 Creston Avenue at 6:42 P.M. on February 11, 2002, a truck arrive and its driver go to the rear door. A light on the second floor went on for a minute. The individual left the house, returned to his truck, and drove off. The police stopped and questioned him about his activities at the address in question. He was identified as Derrick Shattuck and told the police that he had just purchased cocaine from ""Steve"" at that address. Shattuck produced cocaine to the police. He said he was introduced to Steve by Mallon and had been buying from Steve at that address for about three months. According to Shattuck, Steve always had cocaine readily available. Shattuck also confirmed the modus operandi, described by Mallon, of waiting in the kitchen while Steve went upstairs to get the cocaine. Shattuck declined to do a controlled buy.
The police determined to seek a search warrant and to secure the premises while the warrant was being sought and prior to its execution. Some police officers continued to hold Shattuck incommunicado while others went to 88 Creston Avenue, which was a few blocks away. The place where they detained Shattuck was not visible from 88 Creston Avenue, and there was no evidence that the defendant was aware of Shattuck's detention.
When the police arrived at 88 Creston Avenue, they knocked on the door. Through the window panes at the top of the door they saw the defendant, who matched a general description of ""Steve."" An officer asked through the door if they could speak with the defendant, who said ""no"" and then walked quickly out of the officers' sight. [Note 1] An officer then forced open the door with a pry bar. Announcing ""police,"" five or six officers entered the
Page 470
premises and restrained and arrested the defendant as he was coming down from upstairs.
As the defendant was being pat frisked, he stated to the officers, without first being questioned, that he had a .25 caliber weapon upstairs in a dresser drawer and marijuana in his pocket. A bag of marijuana was recovered from the defendant's person. The officers then finished securing the interior of the home by sweeping it for occupants, but did not at that time further search it.
The police then submitted their application for a search warrant shortly after midnight, which included information about the events both prior and subsequent to their entry into the premises. The warrant issued at 12:15 A.M., and upon its execution at 12:30 A.M. the police found a .25 caliber handgun in an upstairs dresser drawer (which was where the defendant had said it was), approximately $1,600 in cash, and two ""cut, clear plastic sandwich baggies."" Apparently, no cocaine was found.
A complaint issued in District Court charging the defendant with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute; drug distribution in a school zone; possession of marijuana; unlawful possession of a firearm; and defacement of a firearm serial number. He brought a pretrial motion to suppress the physical evidence and his statement to police, and evidentiary hearings were held on May 19 and May 28, 2003. The judge denied the motion in a memorandum of decision dated August 26, 2003, ruling that ""[t]he police had reasonable belief that the cocaine would be removed or destroyed unless preventive measures were taken. See Commonwealth v. DeJesus, 439 Mass. 616 (2003)."" A single justice of the Supreme Judicial Court permitted the defendant to bring this interlocutory appeal.
Discussion. "" 'The right of police officers to enter into a home, for whatever purpose, represents a serious governmental intrusion into one's privacy. It was just this sort of intrusion that the Fourth Amendment [to the United States Constitution and art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights were] designed to circumscribe by the general requirement of a judicial determination of probable cause.' Commonwealth v. Forde, 367 Mass. 798 , 805 (1975). Federal and State case law delineates clear boundaries for permissible entry by police officers into a
Page 471
home in order to search or arrest. In the absence of a warrant, two conditions must be met in order for a nonconsensual entry to be valid: there must be probable cause and there must be exigent circumstances."" (Footnote omitted.) Commonwealth v. DeJesus, 439 Mass. 616 , 619 (2003).
Although the defendant does not challenge the judge's determination that the police had probable cause to believe the defendant was distributing cocaine that was located on the premises, he contends that they had no justification for entering the premises without a warrant. The judge ruled that ""[t]he police had reasonable belief that the cocaine would be removed or destroyed unless preventive measures were taken,"" relying on DeJesus, supra at 621, and thus took the view that the police permissibly impounded the interior of the premises to preserve cocaine and related evidence during the time necessarily taken to obtain the search warrant. We examine the contours of the doctrine invoked.
1. Impoundment of premises to preserve evidence during the warrant application process. State and Federal case law has recognized generally that no unreasonable search occurs when police ""secure"" a dwelling, on the basis of probable cause, in order to prevent the destruction or removal of evidence while a search warrant is being sought. Id. at 620-621, and cases cited. The precise boundaries of this police authority are less well explored. In DeJesus, 439 Mass. at 621-622, the Supreme Judicial Court for the first time drew an art. 14 distinction between, on one hand, securing a dwelling on its exterior and, on the other hand, entering and controlling it from the inside. In so deciding, the court ""adhere[d]"" (under art. 14) to Professor LaFave's analysis of Segura v. United States, 468 U.S. 796 (1984), that although the Fourth Amendment allows, without exigent circumstances, a warrantless exterior impoundment of premises pending obtaining a search warrant -- i.e., a seizure alone -- a physical entry to effect an interior impoundment involves both a seizure and a search. See DeJesus, supra at 621-622, citing 3 LaFave, Search & Seizure § 6.5(c), at 365-366 (3d ed. 1996). This warrantless search, albeit a limited one, requires a greater justification than does the external seizure: ""We conclude that there is a fundamental difference between
Page 472
securing or controlling the perimeter of a dwelling from the outside and the entry and physical surveillance of a dwelling from the inside."" DeJesus, supra at 621. The court therefore announced that justification of a warrantless entry into a dwelling to conduct an interior impoundment for preventing destruction or removal of evidence requires circumstances of the following form: ""specific information supporting an objectively reasonable belief that evidence will indeed be removed or destroyed unless preventative measures are taken."" Ibid. [Note 2]
We next consider how the court applied this rule in DeJesus itself. The police had probable cause to believe that cocaine was being kept at the defendant's apartment, id. at 627, but they had no information indicating that the dwelling was occupied at the time they entered and secured it by searching for occupants. Id. at 623-624. The defendant and an accomplice previously had been arrested elsewhere and were in custody at the time of the entry. Id. at 617- 618. The Commonwealth argued that justification for the entry arose from a risk that others knew of the defendant's arrest and that someone inside his apartment might have removed or destroyed evidence. [Note 3] Id. at 622-623. The court rejected the contention:
""We conclude that, although the officers clearly had a right to control the premises from the outside until a search warrant was obtained, they had no basis for believing that immediate entry was necessary to prevent the destruction of evidence. For purposes of deciding this case, we need not determine with precision the minimum requirements that would justify such an entry, as the facts and circumstances here lacked an obvious prerequisite. There was no indication whatsoever that the dwelling was occupied at the time -- the officers had no knowledge that anyone was inside, there was no response to their knocking at the
Page 473
door, and they apparently heard no sounds coming from within. By definition, any evidence located within an unoccupied dwelling can be fully protected by controlling access to that dwelling from the outside. There can be no justification for a warrantless entry absent at least an objectively reasonable belief that someone is inside. On the facts of this case, we agree with the judge's determination that '[a]n officer easily could have been stationed at the door to secure the apartment while [the police] proceeded to obtain a search warrant.' "" (Footnote omitted.)
Id. at 623-624.
2. Application to instant case. The motion judge did not indicate her view of exactly when the constitutional justification for entry arose. Two possibilities suggest themselves. First we consider whether sufficient basis existed just prior to the police approach to the premises, as the Commonwealth first contends. If not, we shift our inquiry to the time when the police interacted with the defendant at his door.
a. Prior to police approach. We consider whether probable cause to believe cocaine was inside the home, plus police knowledge of the defendant's presence there, without more, justified an interior impoundment of the premises. To be sure, there are impoundment cases decided before DeJesus that might be read to support the view that such a known presence would be enough. See Commonwealth v. Blake, 413 Mass. 823 , 827-830 (1992) [Note 4]; Commonwealth v. Voris, 38 Mass. App. Ct. 377 , 380-381 & n.1 (1995); Commonwealth v. Navarro,
Page 474
39 Mass. App. Ct. 161 , 163-164 (1995). Other cases, however, suggest that mere known presence would be insufficient to satisfy the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement. See Commonwealth v. Huffman, 385 Mass. 122 , 125-126 (1982); Commonwealth v. Hamilton, 24 Mass. App. Ct. 290 , 293-295 (1987); Commonwealth v. Wigfall, 32 Mass. App. Ct. 582 , 587-588 (1992); Commonwealth v. Street, 56 Mass. App. Ct. 301 , 306-307 (2002). We believe we are bound to resolve the issue by reliance on the art. 14 test most recently announced in DeJesus, which requires, for an interior impoundment, ""specific information supporting an objectively reasonable belief that evidence will indeed be removed or destroyed unless preventative measures are taken."" 439 Mass. at 621. By this measure, the police had not acquired justification for the warrantless entry prior to approaching the premises. As in DeJesus, ""although the officers clearly had a right to control the premises from the outside until a search warrant was obtained, they had no basis for believing that immediate entry was necessary to prevent the destruction of evidence."" 439 Mass. at 623.
In so deciding, we emphasize the complete absence of evidence of a risk that the defendant had discovered or been informed of the police investigation or the detention of his recent customer. [Note 5] See Commonwealth v. Ortiz, 376 Mass. 349 , 355 (1978); Commonwealth v. Huffman, 385 Mass. at 125 & n.6; Commonwealth v. Sergienko, 399 Mass. 291 , 296-297 (1987); Commonwealth v. Amaral, 16 Mass. App. Ct. 230 , 234-235 (1983); Commonwealth v. Hamilton, 24 Mass. App. Ct. at 293-294; Commonwealth v. Rotolo, 45 Mass. App. Ct. 927 , 928 (1998); Commonwealth v. Harris, 47 Mass. App. Ct. 481 , 486-487 (1999). There was no evidence that the physical configuration of the scene made exterior control of the premises, through continued surveillance or otherwise, likely to alert the defendant to police scrutiny. See Commonwealth v. Hamilton, 24 Mass.
Page 475
App. Ct. at 294. Similarly absent was evidence that the participants in the recent drug sale would disperse immediately afterwards from a temporary location such as a hotel, or that the defendant was likely to become suspicious when a confederate detained by police failed to return or make contact. [Note 6] See Commonwealth v. Curcio, 26 Mass. App. Ct. 738 , 746 (1989); Commonwealth v. Martinez, 47 Mass. App. Ct. 839 , 842-843 (1999). Also of note is the lack of evidence that, in the expected time frame of the warrant application process, either prearranged drug sales were known to be scheduled or spontaneous drug sales were reasonably believed to be imminent in light of prior sales patterns at that location. [Note 7]
b. Upon speaking with the defendant at his door. Although no basis for entry existed beforehand, once the police officers contacted the defendant at his home and alerted him to their presence, the situation changed. They had knocked on the door and simply asked to speak with him. [Note 8] He not only declined, but turned around and began to walk quickly back into the apartment. Upon observing this reaction, the police entered the dwelling, detained the defendant, and conducted a sweep of the premises for other persons. These actions were predicated at that point upon a reasonable belief that the defendant was hastening to destroy or remove the cocaine, a typically adequate basis for warrantless intrusion, see Commonwealth v. Hall, 366 Mass. 790 , 801- 804 (1975); Commonwealth v. Amaral, 16 Mass. App. Ct. at 233-235, and one that would pass muster under the DeJesus test for an interior impoundment. The crux of the matter, however, is whether by coming to the defendant's back
Page 476
door and asking to speak with him, the police impermissibly ""created"" their own justification for entry, as the defendant argues. See Commonwealth v. Forde, 367 Mass. at 802-803; Commonwealth v. Molina, 439 Mass. 206 , 210 (2003); Commonwealth v. Hamilton, 24 Mass. App. Ct. at 293-295.
Ordinarily, police ""officers may make inquiry of anyone they wish and knock on any door, so long as they do not implicitly or explicitly assert that the person inquired of is not free to ignore their inquiries."" Commonwealth v. Murdough, 428 Mass. 760 , 763 (1999). However, it is long settled that ""where the exigency is reasonably foreseeable and the police offer no justifiable excuse for their prior delay in obtaining a warrant, the exigency exception to the warrant requirement is not open to them."" Commonwealth v. Forde, 367 Mass. at 803. There is no indication in the DeJesus opinion that the Forde rule is inapplicable to interior impoundments. Because both the exigent circumstances exception and the DeJesus test for an interior impoundment serve as constitutional justification for warrantless entry, we believe the Forde rationale must equally apply to both situations. [Note 9]
For purposes of the Forde analysis, whether there was ""prior delay in obtaining a warrant"" is related to when probable cause arose. The judge did not articulate a conclusion on this point. The Commonwealth appears to be of the view that probable cause did not exist until the police stop of Shattuck on February 11, the night of the entry. To the contrary, it is clear from our decisions that the police had probable cause to seek a search warrant as of the January 14 controlled buy, even though that buy was conducted through an unsearched intermediary (Mallon), because police surveilled the intermediary as well as the confidential informant. See Commonwealth v. Tshudy, 34 Mass. App. Ct. 955 , 955-957 (1993); Commonwealth v. Villella, 39 Mass. App. Ct. 426 , 427- 428 (1995). Moreover, if there were any doubt that probable cause had been established by the controlled buy, it should have been dispelled by the corroborating interviews of Mallon and Berry in the first week of February.
Page 477
Thus, the police had at least four days to obtain a search warrant, but instead chose to conduct a surveillance of a known, stationary drug distribution operation on a night of their choosing, to detain a departed buyer, and to move in at a time of their choosing without having sought a warrant. [Note 10] The facts show that the police could easily foresee that presenting and announcing themselves on the defendant's doorstep and asking to come in and to speak with him would in all likelihood induce the defendant not only to refuse them admission but also to take steps to conceal or destroy his supply of drugs. Nor has the Commonwealth offered a justifiable excuse for the prior delay in obtaining the warrant. See Commonwealth v. Forde, 367 Mass. at 801-802 (police had probable cause one week prior to police raid and had three hours before development of easily foreseeable exigency that one of arrested confederates would be released that evening and try to warn occupants of defendant's apartment to destroy or remove drugs); Commonwealth v. Krisco Corp., 421 Mass. 37 , 47 (1995). Compare Commonwealth v. Huffman, 385 Mass. at 124-127; Commonwealth v. Hamilton, 24 Mass. App. Ct. at 295. Contrast Commonwealth v. Boswell, 374 Mass. 263 , 270 (1978) (Forde rule did not invalidate warrantless home arrest because defendant's true identity as armed robber being sought was not verified until she answered police knock at door and matched store surveillance photograph; ""At least when probable cause is in doubt, the Forde rule does not prevent the police from knocking on the door of a dwelling in the hope that a suspect will answer the door""). In all the circumstances, we conclude that the police did not obtain justification for the warrantless entry through announcing their presence. [Note 11]
3. Inevitable discovery and independent source. Having
Page 478
concluded that the police entry into the dwelling was not permissible, we consider the remedy. ""Evidence need not be excluded under the 'fruit of the poisonous tree' doctrine established in Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 488 (1963), even if the government misconduct was a cause 'in fact' of the discovery of the evidence, 'if the government obtained the evidence through an independent source, if the connection between the improper conduct and the derivative evidence has become so attenuated as to dissipate the taint, or if the government can demonstrate that the evidence inevitably would have been discovered by lawful means.' Commonwealth v. Fredette, 396 Mass. 455 , 459 (1985) (citations omitted)."" Commonwealth v. Barros, 56 Mass. App. Ct. 675 , 679 (2002).
As to the cash and the plastic baggies, the independent source rule requires the denial of the suppression motion. This is so because these items were discovered not as a product of the unlawful entry, but during the later execution of the search warrant, and because, even if the information obtained from the unlawful entry is excised from the search warrant application, the application still established probable cause for the proper issuance of the warrant. See DeJesus, 439 Mass. at 624-627, citing Segura, 468 U.S. at 813-814.
Page 479
The Commonwealth has not argued that one of the exceptions to the exclusionary rule would allow in evidence the statement of the defendant or the marijuana found on his person at the time of arrest. Good reason exists for the implicit concession. Although the police had probable cause to arrest the defendant, by doing so in his home without justification for the lack of a warrant they violated the rule of Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 590 (1980). The statement and the marijuana must be suppressed. See Commonwealth v. Marquez, 434 Mass. 370 , 378 (2001) (""The penalty for an unlawful arrest in a defendant's dwelling is the suppression of anything seized at the time of the arrest, either from the defendant or in the dwelling, and any statements made at the time of the arrest""); Commonwealth v. Molina, 439 Mass. at 211.
More complex is the admissibility of the handgun. On one hand, the defendant's statement alerted the police to its presence and location, and the warrant application and the warrant expressly referred to the handgun. On the other hand, the police did not search for or seize the handgun until they executed the warrant. The question, then, is whether the handgun must be suppressed as fruit of the unlawfully obtained statement or whether it ought to be admitted under the inevitable discovery doctrine. Although the judge made no finding on the point, we shall assume for purposes of decision (and to the benefit of the defendant) that as a factual matter the police relied on the defendant's statement in locating and seizing the handgun. [Note 12]
The inevitable discovery rule under art. 14 ""requires a two-step analysis which focuses, first, on the question of inevitability, and, second, on the character of the police misconduct."" Commonwealth v. Perrot, 407 Mass. 539 , 546 (1990). ""[T]he Commonwealth has the burden of proving the facts bearing on inevitability by a preponderance of the evidence and, once the relevant facts have been proved, that discovery by lawful means was 'certain as a practical matter.' "" Id. at 547, quoting from Commonwealth v. O'Connor, 406 Mass. 112 , 117 (1989). ""[T]he severity of the constitutional violation is critical in
Page 480
deciding whether to admit evidence that it is shown would inevitably have been discovered."" Commonwealth v. O'Connor, supra at 118. ""Bad faith of the police, shown by such activities as conducting an unlawful search in order to accelerate discovery of the evidence, will be relevant in assessing the severity of any constitutional violation."" Ibid.
Although the judge here made no specific findings regarding inevitable discovery, [Note 13] given the findings she did make and under any rational view of the evidence introduced by the Commonwealth at the suppression hearing, the circumstances here met the first prong of the test. As noted earlier, the warrant properly issued on probable cause even excluding the information obtained from the unlawful entry. The terms of the warrant authorized the police to search for cocaine and any related paraphernalia. [Note 14] As the undisputed evidence revealed, the handgun was stored in an upstairs dresser drawer, on the same floor where the police believed the cocaine was kept. Given that a handgun is at least as large as some of the items being sought under the warrant, we conclude that police discovery of the handgun in plain view while searching for the cocaine or related items was ""certain as a practical matter."" Commonwealth v. O'Connor, supra at 117. See Commonwealth v. Wills, 398 Mass. 768 , 774-775 (1986) (""The permissible intensity of a search is determined by the description of the items to be seized. The size of the object or objects sought affects the appropriate scope of the search. . . . For example, police officers may look in an envelope if they are searching for drugs"" [citations omitted]). See also Commonwealth v. Silva, 61 Mass. App. Ct. 28 , 31 (2004) (outlining requirements of plain view doctrine:
Page 481
lawful vantage point; immediately apparent incriminating character; and inadvertent discovery).
We next consider the severity of the constitutional violation. The statement was the result of an unlawful in-home arrest flowing from an entry based on probable cause, but without justification for the lack of a warrant, and conducted for the purpose of impounding the premises while a warrant could be sought. While the lack of a warrant is not to be taken lightly, there is no indication that the police acted in bad faith to accelerate the discovery of the evidence through an unconstitutional shortcut. See Commonwealth v. O'Connor, supra at 118 & n.5. Indeed, the police action here, in February, 2002, predated the opinion of the Supreme Judicial Court in DeJesus, 439 Mass. 616 , 621 (2003), stating for the first time that an interior impoundment of premises requires, in addition to probable cause to search, ""specific information supporting an objectively reasonable belief that evidence will indeed be removed or destroyed"" while a warrant is sought. Prior to that decision, our cases had drawn no distinction between exterior and interior impoundments, and the decisions seemingly approved of entries to secure premises simply on the basis of persons being present therein. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Blake, 413 Mass. at 829-830 [Note 15]; Commonwealth v. Voris, 38 Mass. App. Ct. at 380-381 & n.1; Commonwealth v. Navarro, 39 Mass. App. Ct. at 163-164. Thus, the police here were simply doing what a reasonable view of the existing case law allowed them to do: they acted on probable cause, they limited their initial intrusion to securing the premises, they sought a warrant, and they conducted no further search until the warrant arrived. In the circumstances, we do not view the constitutional violation as severe enough to require suppression. Because both aspects of the inevitable discovery rule are satisfied, the handgun should be allowed in evidence.
The order denying the motion to suppress is affirmed as to the handgun, the cash, and the plastic baggies. The balance of the order is reversed, and a new order shall enter suppressing the marijuana and the defendant's statement to police.

A motion judge did not err in denying a criminal defendant's motion to suppress evidence seized by police during a search of an apartment and a motor vehicle, where the defendant failed to demonstrate that the police violated the ""knock and announce"" rule in their execution of the warrant at the apartment [523], and where the warrant provided sufficient evidence to link the motor vehicle to the defendant's alleged criminal activity [523-524].

Background. On October 2, 2003, the New Bedford police simultaneously executed three search warrants [Note 2] as part of an investigation into the defendant's large-scale drug operation. [Note 3] The search warrants were issued based upon the affidavits of Detective Michael Carrier, a member of the organized crime intelligence unit specializing in narcotics investigations, and a ten year veteran of the police force. The affidavits recite information supplied by a confidential informant and by other members of the New Bedford police who conducted a surveillance of the defendant.
The motion judge ruled that the search warrant application for 63 Monroe Drive failed to establish the requisite nexus between the objects sought and the location to be searched in that neither the confidential informant nor the police had actually seen any ""records, ledgers, or proceeds inside 63 Monroe Drive and police surveillance never discovered Santiago or his accomplice bringing such proceeds, records, or ledgers into 63 Monroe Drive.""

App. Ct. 426 , 428 (1995). We summarize the facts recited in the affidavits. [Note 5] During the week of August 10, 2003, Sergeant Victor Mendes of the New Bedford police learned from a confidential informant [Note 6] of a ""lucrative cocaine distribution enterprise"" in the Presidential Heights housing project in New Bedford. According to the informant, an individual known to ""it"" [Note 7] as ""Oscar"" [Note 8] (the defendant) was running a drug operation involving several residences, cars, [Note 9] and subordinates.
The informant had purchased cocaine from Oscar over the past several months. To initiate a purchase, the informant would call the defendant at a phone number it had been given and would state the desired amount of cocaine. The defendant or one of his subordinates would then meet the informant in the area of Monroe Drive and Van Buren Street, where the drug sale would occur. The informant also described a number of cars the defendant occupied, including a blue Nissan Maxima. The affiant further learned from the informant and other detectives that the defendant lived in the Presidential Heights housing project in New Bedford,
Page 518
and appeared to be staying at his mother's residence at 63 Monroe Drive. [Note 10]
Based on this information, Carrier, with the assistance of other members of the New Bedford police, assembled a surveillance team for 63 Monroe Drive and arranged for several controlled buys from the defendant involving the informant.
During the week of August 10, 2003, the surveillance team observed the defendant standing on Van Buren Street in the area of Monroe Drive. Sergeant Mendes then initiated a first controlled buy involving the informant. The informant, upon leaving Mendes's custody, went directly to the defendant, exchanged money for cocaine, and returned to Mendes to whom it handed the drugs.
During the week of August 31, surveillance was again set up in the area of 63 Monroe Drive. The surveillance team observed a group of three males in the area of Monroe Drive and Van Buren Street. For the second controlled buy, the informant again made phone contact with the defendant and was instructed to proceed to the area of Monroe Drive for the exchange. As the informant approached the area, ""Coco,"" subsequently identified as Orlando Martinez-Cirino, left the group of males and entered one of the apartments at 63-65 Monroe Drive, emerging again shortly thereafter. [Note 11] When Coco returned to the group, he exchanged drugs for money with the informant.
In preparation for the third controlled buy during the week of September 21, the informant again called the defendant. This time it was instructed to come to a different location. As the surveillance team was transitioning to the new location, Coco was observed operating a blue Nissan Maxima. As the vehicle approached the designated location, the defendant also arrived in a different car. The informant met with Santiago and after a short conversation, Santiago went over to the blue Nissan
Page 519
Maxima. He entered the vehicle for about ten seconds, walked back to the informant, and exchanged drugs for money.
Within seventy-two hours before obtaining the first search warrants, [Note 12] the surveillance team again observed Coco and Santiago entering and exiting the parked blue Nissan Maxima. In preparation for a fourth controlled buy, the informant again made phone contact with the defendant. It was told to come to the area of Monroe Drive. The surveillance team observed as the informant, Santiago, and Coco approached that location. Santiago walked directly to the informant, who handed him the buy money. Santiago then signaled Coco, who was observing from a distance. The officers then saw Coco enter an apartment on Van Buren Street. He emerged again after approximately one minute and walked directly to the informant, to whom he handed the cocaine. The informant then returned to Detective Carrier and handed him the cocaine.
In addition, Carrier stated that he and other members of his unit on numerous occasions observed Santiago going in and out of the apartment at 63 Monroe Drive, leading them to believe that he resided there. The defendant appeared to be entering the apartment without knocking and, at times, using a key. He also would remain inside the apartment for extended periods of time. The informant further stated that on at least one occasion the defendant exited the front door at 63 Monroe Drive and directly went to the informant to sell drugs. Based on police surveillance and information obtained from the confidential informant, Carrier determined that 63 Monroe Drive constituted the base of the defendant's operations.
Surveillance revealed that the defendant and his associates used Nextel cellular phones and, on a number of occasions, were also using the two-way communication feature of these phones. Additionally, the confidential informant would call the defendant's cell phone number to arrange for drug deals.
Detective Carrier further stated that he observed how the defendant, Coco, and other associates were approached by a number of people in motor vehicles or on foot. After brief
Page 520
conversations, the defendant or Coco would go to 152 Van Buren Street, return shortly thereafter, and engage in an exchange with the waiting party. Carrier stated that based on his experience and training, this was consistent with illicit drug activity.
Detective Carrier's specialized training and experience indicated that it is common practice for upper level drug dealers such as the defendant to store the narcotics and their proceeds in separate locations. Carrier concluded, therefore, based on information provided by the confidential informant and police surveillance, that the bulk of the narcotics were under the immediate control of Coco at 152 Van Buren Street, while the proceeds, records, or ledgers, including his cellular phone and any records it generated, were located at 63 Monroe Drive, which appeared to be the defendant's residence.
The motion judge denied the defendant's motion to suppress the evidence found in the blue Nissan Maxima and at 152 Van Buren Street. He also ruled against the defendant on his claim that the police had violated the ""knock and announce rule"" when they entered the apartments at 152 Van Buren Street and 63 Monroe Drive.
Conversely, with regard to the affidavit in support of the search warrant for 63 Monroe Drive, the motion judge determined that ""the affidavit failed to establish a sufficient nexus between drug records, ledgers, and proceeds and 63 Monroe Drive."" [Note 13] He therefore suppressed all the evidence derived from the execution of the search warrant at that location, including the statements taken from the defendant during the execution of the warrant. [Note 14]
On appeal, the Commonwealth challenges the motion judge's
Page 521
determination that the information in support of the warrant application for 63 Monroe Drive failed to establish the necessary nexus between proceeds and records of the defendant's drug business and the apartment. The defendant, in his cross-appeal, claims that the judge improperly denied his motion to suppress with regard to the blue Nissan Maxima and the apartment at 152 Van Buren Street.
Nexus. ""The information in the affidavit must be adequate to establish a timely nexus between the defendant and the location to be searched and to permit the determination that the particular items of criminal activity sought reasonably could be expected to be found there."" Commonwealth v. Wade, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 648 , 651 (2005). ""Furthermore, the affidavit should be read as a whole, not parsed, severed, and subjected to hypercritical analysis."" Commonwealth v. O'Day, 440 Mass. at 301, quoting from Commonwealth v. Blake, 413 Mass. 823 , 827 (1992).
""In each case, the basic question for the magistrate is whether he has a substantial basis for concluding that any of the articles described in the warrant are probably in the place to be searched."" Commonwealth v. Upton, 394 Mass. 363 , 370 (1985). To arrive at that conclusion, the magistrate ""may apply common knowledge and may draw reasonable inferences from the facts before him."" Commonwealth v. Taglieri, 378 Mass. 196 , 198 (1979). ""This is consistent with the view that 'affidavits for search warrants . . . must be tested and interpreted by magistrates and courts in a commonsense and realistic fashion.' "" Ibid., quoting from United States v. Ventresca, 380 U.S. 102, 108 (1965).
Further, ""weight must be given to the special experience of a law enforcement officer who has executed an affidavit. For example, where such an officer states that he has drawn inferences from facts which an inexperienced person might not draw from those facts, the magistrate may rely on those inferences."" Taglieri, supra at 199. See Grasso & McEvoy, Suppression Matters under Massachusetts Law § 10-5(b)(1) (2004-2005).
In the present case, Detective Carrier was a longstanding member of the New Bedford police force with significant
Page 522
experience and training in narcotics investigations. Based on this experience, he concluded that in a drug operation of the size carried out by the defendant, the bulk of the drugs would usually be kept separate from any records or proceeds affiliated with the operation.
On the basis of the affidavit, it was reasonable, if not compelling, to conclude that the defendant was a drug dealer responsible for a large-scale operation; that he resided at, or at least had unlimited access to, 63 Monroe Drive; that he and his subordinates used record-generating cellular telephones; that the bulk of the narcotics were not kept at 63 Monroe Drive; and that the defendant had access to a blue Nissan Maxima, from which drugs were delivered and in which he met with his compatriot to transact ""business."" See Commonwealth v. Taglieri, 378 Mass. at 199; Commonwealth v. Cruz, 430 Mass. 838 , 842-843 (2000).
Thus, taking the affidavit as a whole, interpreting it in a commonsense fashion, and relying on Carrier's experience, the clerk-magistrate properly concluded that the affidavit established probable cause that records of the defendant's narcotics operation could be found at 63 Monroe Drive. See ibid.
Drug dealers do not provide receipts for product purchases; nor are informants privy to the private business records of any money generating drug enterprise. What records are kept, and surely they are, given the nature of the business, are typically beyond the reach of police surveillance. Once it was established that the defendant was operating a drug business that included 63 Monroe Drive, [Note 15] little, if anything more, needed to be added in the affidavit to justify searching for ""records, ledgers, or proceeds."" [Note 16]
Page 523
Cross-appeal. The defendant argues the invalidity of the search at 152 Van Buren Street in that the police did not ""knock and announce.""
""The requirement that police 'knock and announce' their presence and purpose prior to the execution of a search warrant"" is a principle of the Massachusetts common law. Commonwealth v. Jimenez, 438 Mass. 213 , 215 (2002). ""Among the purposes of this rule are the protection of individual privacy interests and the desire to minimize the potential for violence or property damage."" Commonwealth v. Macias, 429 Mass. 698 , 701 (1999).
At a suppression hearing, the motion judge heard testimony from police officers, the defendant, and Sindia Ramos, a resident at 152 Van Buren Street, with regard to whether the police properly knocked and announced their imminent entries into the apartments at 63 Monroe Drive and 152 Van Buren Street. In assessing credibility, the judge accepted the testimony of the police. There is no justification to upset that valid determination. See Commonwealth v. Mims, 12 Mass. App. Ct. 962 , 963 (1981).
A closer case concerns the 370 grams of cocaine, two guns and one spent bullet, discovered in the blue Maxima, the sole vehicle, of the many the defendant used, for which the police sought a warrant. The defendant was observed as the driver and passenger of the blue Nissan Maxima to which, in the third controlled buy, the defendant returned to apparently secure the drugs from Coco, the driver. [Note 17] Within seventy-two hours prior to applying for the warrant to search the blue Nissan Maxima, (1) the police observed Coco and the defendant entering and exiting the car in a parked position in the area of Monroe Drive and Van Buren Street; and (2) the confidential informant notified Detective Carrier that it had again purchased cocaine from Santiago who was operating the blue Nissan Maxima at the time.
It is reasonable to infer that drugs were kept inside the motor vehicle and produced from there to conduct drug transactions, most notably during the third controlled buy. The car also served as a meeting place, in that the defendant and Coco met and
Page 524
talked in the parked vehicle. It is not a leap of conjecture that discussions about illicit drug activity were conducted within the secreted, stationary area. Every time a request for drugs was made, they were nearly instantaneously available, evidence of the large-scale nature of the operation, and the ability of the dealers to supply their product.
The defendant cites Commonwealth v. Wade, 64 Mass. App. Ct. 648 (2005), in support of his argument. In Wade, this court found the search warrant insufficient as ""the only evidence linking the vehicle to criminal activity being the two staged purchases where the defendant arrived in the Explorer."" Id. at 653. Cf. Commonwealth v. Staines, 441 Mass. 521 , 528-529 (2004). Here, as has been noted, there is more. First, there is the extensive drug operation itself, involving different apartments and vehicles. Second, the defendant and his cohort were observed by police meeting in the parked car, ostensibly discussing their business, most recently three days prior to the warrant application. Third, there was a controlled buy in which the defendant returned to the car, driven by Coco, to retrieve the drugs that were sold to the informant. This suggests that drugs were kept and ready in the car. Fourth, there is the report of a noncontrolled drug purchase by the informant within seventy-two hours before the search warrant was issued, in which the defendant used the car to deliver the drugs. As the motion judge concluded, ""the proximate uses of the [vehicle] to facilitate drug sales"" supported a reasonable inference ""that the blue Nissan Maxima contained contraband, evidence of drug sales, or proceeds from drug transactions."" ""The fact that there may be other explanations for the activities observed by the police does not negate the proposition that the described activity is, in the opinion of experienced drug investigators, consistent with drug selling and may be considered in the probable cause equation."" Commonwealth v. O'Day, 440 Mass. at 302 n.6.
Reading the affidavit in a commonsense, nonhypertechnical, manner, id. at 304 n.8, supports the conclusion of the motion judge denying the defendant's motion to suppress this evidence.
Conclusion. The order suppressing evidence derived from
Page 525
execution of the search warrant at 63 Monroe Drive is reversed. [Note 18] With regard to 152 Van Buren Street and the blue Nissan Maxima, the motion judge's ruling is affirmed.
So ordered.","March 21, 2006 - June 13, 2006",
