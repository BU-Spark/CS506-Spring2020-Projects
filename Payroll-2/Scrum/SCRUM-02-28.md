SCRUM 02-28

1) We have scraped all of the data discussed in our meeting with the client last Friday (Lowell, Worchester, Quincy, New Bedford). We tried to begin analyzing it but ran into a few issues we discussed in deliverable 1. ie: weird formatting of data, so it was difficult to parse through. 

2) We plan to fix this issue by hopefully cleaning up the data somehow before attempting to parse through it. 


3) Yes. Weird formatting of data and nomenclature of the police departments in each city is not uniform.
