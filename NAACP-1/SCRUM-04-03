1. What has the team done towards the project this week?
The team finished cleaning the data using TF-IDF, nltk, and TextBlob packages

2. Is the team having any issue?
When we searched the sub-neighborhood name in the articles, the articles sometimes do not return effective results. For example, it would either return none or multiple sub-neighborhoods. We are having trouble deciding whether this is an black sub-neighborhood related news or not.

3. What work does the team plan to do next week?
The team wants to separate articles by labling the as black or non-black sub-neighborhood related news and apply sentiment analysis to them.
