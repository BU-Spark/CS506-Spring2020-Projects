1. What work has the team done toward the project this week?
	
    We used VADER-Sentiment-Analysis an open source lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool to do sentiment analysis on a small data. Decide to move another way to sort the articles into Black & Non-Black, by looking up the name of a sub-neighborhood it mentions instead of a specific address.

2. Is the team having any issues?
	
    Our ideas were limited by using full address to label the article at the beginning. Then we realized it was limited and we can not ensure if the whole article is really about that place, or just a location it happened to mentioned.

3. What work does the team plan to do next week?
	
    Combine census track number with sub-neighborhoods' name; finish grouping article and do sentimental analysis on them
