1. What work has the team done toward the project this week?
 We used a tool, Geocoder US Census Geographies, to find the corresponding census tracts for each sub-neighborhood so that we can identify the black community based on the census tracts (as we have collected the population data for each census tracts before).

2. Is the team having any issues?
 The way to figure out the corresponding census tracts for each sub-neighborhood that the mentor gave us is not applicable, so one of our team members figured out a new way and finally we solved this issues.

3. What work does the team plan to do next week?
 We plan to utilize Scrapy to scrape the texts between Year 2014 and Year 2018 from Boston Globe and Boston Herald websites.
