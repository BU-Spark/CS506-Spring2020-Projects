Work Completed:
We were asked to look at the subset of Boston Globe articles that explicitly mention race as well as homicide coverage. We have prepared the code base for pre-processing the text and removing stop words, creating tokens, and searching for key words.

Next Week Target:
We will work on de-bugging the code base and preparing a draft/initial results about the topics most closely related to articles that explicitly mention race as well as the volume of homicide coverage of Black/African-American victims relative to people of other racial groups. 

Difficulties Faced:
1. We are having some issues with our code for pre-processing the text and need help debugging it.
