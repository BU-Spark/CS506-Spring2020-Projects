                                                    Scrum Report, Mar 06
                                    Team Members - Shubhangi Jain, Nada Shalash


Work Completed:
We were tasked to collect and review the local news section of the Boston Herald between 2014 and 2019. This week we were not able to achieve it, as the scraping script shared was giving error. We debugged it and made changes but still, it’s giving error.

Next Week Target:
We will review the Boston Herald news reports collected by team who was working in Fall 2019 on the NAACP project till the time scraping script issue is resolved. 

Difficulties Faced:
1. (Same as reported in the last scrum as well) We are down from 4 people to 2 people. One of the team members (Krishna Chaitanya:pallekc@bu.edu) dropped the course. Another team member (Sabrina: sabrinaa@bu.edu) got dropped from the course as her waitlist didn’t clear. It will be really helpful if we can have one more person on the team. 
2. Scraping script which was given us to collect the data from the Boston Herald was not working, so it became a major road blocker for this week task.
