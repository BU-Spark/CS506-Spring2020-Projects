1. Finish updating project code structure. Starting implementable removal of unsable land. 
Successfully able transform address into coordinates in EPSG 26986 formatts to match with MassGIS shp file format, but havent run algorithm on the entire dataset yet.

2. For next week: Will fix bug in spliting transportation and housing algorithm, merge again with Taylor dataset to see if there are differences.
If have time, run remove algorithm on all addresses, and remove addresses in water body.

3. Team work has been challening.
