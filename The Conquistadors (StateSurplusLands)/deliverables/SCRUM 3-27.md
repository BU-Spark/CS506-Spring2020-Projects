1. This past week our team filter the dataset by land user code that start with 9, and take the result dataset merge with the agency list dataset using fuzzywuzzy on names. 
The results are not great, because the number of matches are low. Started using ATTOM API to evaluate addresses based on neighborhood values.

2. Next week we will try to finish the ATTOM API integration, and separate the dataset into housing and transportation categories.

3. Manuja who did not register for our class but was helping our group, now is unable to further join group work due to remote classes.
Team work has been challenging
