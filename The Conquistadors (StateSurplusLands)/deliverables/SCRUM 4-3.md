1. Finished working on ATTOM Integration but have not run on whole dataset as our dataset has not finalized with Taylorâ€™s team. Also, ATTOM trial account only limits 10 API call per minute and around 100-200 calls in a span of few days. 
This could be troublesome for later implementation

2. Hope to finish split data into transportation and housing by next week. Research more about street standardizing algorithm.

3. Team work has been challenging
