1. This week our team work on cleaning up the dataset.More Specifically we work on clean up the OwnerName and OwnerAddress columns by 
matching ownernames to the same owner address, then standardize the names and correct any mis-fomatted names.

2. Next week our team plan to work on research/work on the Zillow API to more useful information about the addresses in interest. Also
match owner names with another group's cleaned up data to form a consenus.

3. We have many tasks at hand we need to accomlish in a short amount of time.
