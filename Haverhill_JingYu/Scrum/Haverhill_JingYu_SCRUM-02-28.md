1. Our team perform data cleaning on the most recent version of the 3-1-1 requests CSV file. Because  this CSV file contains more than 150,000 data entries, with 33 attributes for each data entry, causing this a great obstacle for us to divide the types of data into categories, and further manipulate them within each wards / precincts.  Also, we make use of the types of calls made, and create heatmaps separately for easier visualization for the decision makers to divide labor accordingly to our visual analysis.
2.  We plan to draw the boundaries in the specific region in order to have a clear perspective and plot different wards/precincts with different colors.
3. We have issues about how to use GIS.
