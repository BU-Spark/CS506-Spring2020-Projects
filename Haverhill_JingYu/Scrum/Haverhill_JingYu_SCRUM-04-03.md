1. This week, we do the data cleaning to only keep useful columns using pandas and focus on Departments that take care of issues by dropping all NaN entries. Then we find 15 departments and sort these departments. Our approach is to visualize number of requests categorized by departments. Then we transfer to csv file.
2. We plan to paint wards based on number of requests and create color map next week.
3. We don't have issue this week.
