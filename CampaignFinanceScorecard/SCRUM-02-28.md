1. The team had some difficulties due to the unexpected unavailability of some team members. We managed to finish most of the data collection and do some basic analysis.
2. Next week, we plan to finish the data collection portion and perform a deeper analysis.
3. There are some issues with the data collection, particularly scraping the Secretary of State website, but we are working with the clients and Spark coordinators to resolve it.
