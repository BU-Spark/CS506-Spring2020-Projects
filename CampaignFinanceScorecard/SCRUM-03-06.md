1. We have made good progress with the scraping of websites for augmenting our existing dataset.
2. Next week, we plan to wrap up the scrapers by plugging in the final component, which will analyse PDF files.
3. The scraping is tricky because of the huge amount of data and the lack of consistency in PDF quality (some are unreadable), but otherwise there are no issues.
