# SCRUM-03-20
1. Progress was minimal this week given the transition to online classes.
2. Next week, we plan to finish the final component of the scraper, to analyze PDF documents. (Have identified some good python libraries for the same).
3. Plenty of the PDF's are unreadable and as of now, we plan to skip over those.
