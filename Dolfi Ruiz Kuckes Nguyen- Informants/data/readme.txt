In all three folders there is a division between files called "cases" and files called "case_appeals". "Cases" are the full text of decisions from the SJC (supreme judicial court). "case_appeals" are decisions from the statewide appeals courts. The folder "new data with right fields" contains the new scraped data in a better format. The new data is from roughly 2000-2008 and 2018-march 2020
