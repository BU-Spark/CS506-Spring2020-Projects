1. What work has the team done toward the project this week?

We use Namsor API to generate the column of ethnicity of our collected data. Also we filter out the table of position ‘police’ out of our data.

2. What work does the team plan to do next week?

We try to generate more data by Namsor API. And we need to make the draft of our final report.

3. Is the team having any issues?

Now we can only generate 5000 genders and 450 ethnicity one account. We need to solve that problem.
