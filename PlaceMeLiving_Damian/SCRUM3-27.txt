Progress this week:* We finished label data from twitter last week but realized that we did not have enough data. We tried to find a Facebook crawler that is similar to what we have for twitter but we did not find one. We tried to search keywords manually.* We listed some questions about difficulty we are facing right now.Plan for next week:* Collect all data from Facebook. * We probably need more data. We will manually search from Instagram or other social media.* Discuss our question with Spark and the PlaceMe Living Company.
