Sorrena D.,5,"I just read all the reviews on Michelle and i wanted to say i agree with most! She's a hard working, very professional manager. She's very welcoming and goes the extra mile to help her tenants. 

We know she's juggling a lot of work right now but she makes sure our problems are addressed. 

Thanks Michelle, My roommates and I have just moved into the apartment and it is already starting to feeling like home.

We really look forward to living here and appreciate your help."

I have been living here for 4 years already and they change the management team for a while and the new manager Michelle and her team is doing excellent job. She cares about her tenants and know what they need and get he job done quickly. I have requested repairs-and-fix for several times. All of them are finished in 2 hours. The environment is safe and quiet. Five stars! Check it out guys!"
Jorge L C.,5,"I love the high level of professionalism Michelle, the leasing manager had displayed several times when I've gone with any questions or concerns. 
-Michelle truly is an ambassador of the Bungalow Apts Brand for her dedication and passion for this Co.  I really hope she is well noticed for doing so. She is super efficient and goes above and beyond to keep all tenants safe and happy. Always with a smile on and willing to help, she stays on top the facilities needs and displays great team work amongst her employees. 
I will continue to re new my lease with her and hope such talented and caring leader never leaves. I highly recommend these Apts to future tenants! "

From the moment I called in to get information on one of the units she has been so helpful so informative and attentive every step of the way, she made the whole process stress free and as easy as possible.

We just got our approval yesterday and are so excited to be making this our new home!

Thank you so much for all your help Michelle, you are truly amazing!"
Alma R.,5,"This is by far the friendliest community we've visited. It's a nice park like community with many amenities: pool, jacuzzi, gym, rec. room, playground, and lost of green space for my fur babies. 

The management team is also great! The property manager responded to my numerous late night emails, and questions very quickly. She has been great helping us get into our first home. We are super excited to move into our new home! 

Thank you, Bungalows leasing office team!"
Twailla M.,5,"I have a friend who's lived at this complex for over a year. Because she's so happy with her unit, The Bungalows was immediately one of the apartments we considered when it was time to move. The manager is very helpful, and she's gone above and beyond to help us with through the process and answer all of our questions. I'm impressed with how quickly she was able to pull everything together. The complex itself is well-maintained. In-unit laundry hookups ... Yes!!"
