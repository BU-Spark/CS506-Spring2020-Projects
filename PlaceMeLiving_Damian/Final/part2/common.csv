1,5,"I have really enjoyed my time living at Fairview in The Commons. If you're transitioning to NYC or need soft place to land before your next move, The Commons is a great place to do so. The staff was always helpful and kind. Thanks for a great time!"
2,5,"
I really want to thank Common for helping me through this very difficult Corona-Virus situation and helping me navigate the best course of action for me financially. Every single email always began with kind words and a sense that I wasn't alone, and I would find a way through.
This experiance shows the staff really tries to do their best by tenants and that really makes them rare among NYC.

I also loved Havermayer, seriously awesome commute to work."
3,5,"Common has beautiful homes/rooms, but that is not what sold me. The representative I was assigned in NYC, Jurvany, was amazing. She personalized my wants and found me the best option and with a fast turn around. Common's application to move-in process I found to be extremely organized. If you are looking in the city, when you call... ask for Jaye. I'm unsure if I would have found what I was looking for as quickly as I was able to without her."
4,5,"Common is affordable, user-friendly, and a safe environment to live in.  I'm glad I made this choice!"
5,5,"A great alternative to the old way of finding an apartment through a broker. Some key pluses or coliving include not having to track down roommates and negotiate cost sharing yourself, not having to pay as much up front (only need 1st month's rent, plus security deposit can be  paid per month), the apartments come furnished (especially useful for those of us coming from overseas), and the shared apartment basics (soap, TP, paper towels, laundry & detergent,  etc) are included in rent. Only complaint so far is you may need to remind them to restock these essentials as they often forget during the weekly cleanings. They're generally pretty responsive to maintenance requests, just be sure to follow up in case it gets delayed."
6,5,"I currently live in Common Simonds in Chicago and it's been great! The building used to be owned by another management company but the transition has been seamless and when I found out we were switching to Common I was pumped!  

The Simonds building consists of all individual apartments which is awesome rather than a lot of other Common buildings where you rent out a room and share a common space. The only drawback of this is that the feeling is a tad less communal than what I'd imagine other Common buildings to be. That said you still get access to all of the local events, Common Member portal and the same perks as anywhere else.  

One other think to mention about Simonds specifically is that the apartments are TINY. BUT you get literally everything you need. Dishwasher, full Washer/Dryer in unit, all new appliances and fixtures. I think my entire place including bathroom and closet is 250sq ft? The best way I can describe it is like living in a tiny home. If you are the type to want to live minimally then this is a GREAT place to test those waters out. I've found myself paring down a lot of my belongings and am way happier as a result. :)

The response time regarding any issues or questions is super quick (special shout out to Jenna North who is THE best) and they never leave you hanging. The level of service surrounding tenants is unlike any management company I've ever experienced.  

Basically, nothing about Common is normal and I mean that in the BEST way possible. The housing market needed a change. (Insert thumbs up here)"
7,5,"I have nothing but good things to say about Common Living. The apartment complexes are clean, comfortable, and well-maintained, while the property management team is easy-to-work with, organized, caring, and prompt. After living in a smaller apartment for two years in a complex owned by Common, I reached out to Jenna, the Customer Success Manager, to let her know I needed more space and was looking for other apartments. She quickly scheduled a meeting to discuss what type of apartment I was looking for, and she literally found the PERFECT fit. This was no easy feat, as I was very specific in what I was looking for - a complex close to Lake Union, with a patio and view of the water, a lofted studio space with full amenities, in Eastlake (a neighborhood I love), at a reasonable price.  Miraculously, she found EXACTLY that, but even better- a BRAND NEW complex at a price I could afford! I was thrilled, and couldn't wait to move in. She even scheduled multiple tours for me to view the complex, to provide full confidence in my decision to transfer buildings. And on top of that, she timed the move-in so I can easily transfer from my current lease to the next without paying double rent. With their awesome customer service team and great apartments, I plan to stay with Common Living until I buy property. Although I may just stay permanently!"
8,5,"You will not be disappointed by any aspect of Common Living.
As a child I lived in Chicago rentals and as an adult have rented apartments from several management companies throughout the city. I can honestly say Common has quickly become my favorite management company.
Since Common has taken over my apartment complex, two months ago, they have been attentive to the needs of their new tenants. Emails communicating important building related topics are timely and phone calls with a caring customer success manager are available all week at your convenience. Not to mention the many community events available to tenants are a great addition to city living.
I recommend Common Living to anyone looking to rent from a company who genuinely cares.
Thank you Common staff for all you do!"
9,5,"I recently moved back to Chicago after being away for four years, I wanted to live in the city, but find something ideal for my lifestyle being a minimalist, I didn't want to buy any furniture, I wanted a location with easy access to transit to the loop, safe neighborhood and within a reasonable cost. Common was IT for me! I started correspondence after inquiring and emails back and forth was effortless and timely.
I moved in swiftly, the facilities are amazing and the neighborhood is perfect, I am literally 25mins from Chicago Loop and the ease of having everything I need included in my membership is a no brainer. I highly recommend Common Living!]"
0,5,"It's been awesome living at a Common apartment. As well Lior always is helping us to find something awesome to do!
"
11,5,"Excellent apartment and beautifully designed. Great assistance from the administration.
"
12,5,"It has been almost a year since I have been living in my current building. Ever since common took over,there was an obvious good change in the service provided;
Quick responses to emails, clear instructions, professionalism, constant updates, prompt service  
and a very good communication. The transition was made  smoothly and
Efficiently. With Common, you  feel your matters and concerns actually matter to them as they always keep in touch asking about your needs and seeking your satisfaction. I would highly recommend common management Whenever you are moving next."
13,5,"I went with a 6-month contract for the Fairview home in Queens, NY. It's been solid - the apartment is kept tidy and clean, the furnishings are stylish and modern, I'm very close to public transit, and the Customer Support Manager and Support Team handle issues quickly. I've also had a chance to go to a few interesting events like the Color Factory pop-up. I think this company is great if you're looking for shorter term leases, tend to be a minimalist (if it doesn't fit in my suitcases, I don't want it), and are generally independent."
14,5,3 months in and it's been a great experience thus far. The apartments are new and clean (Common Terry) and the support has been really attentive and consistent. Lior in particular is always super helpful!
15,5,"I toured a common apartment when I was visiting NY with my sister, she might be moving up there. Lawrence showed us around and it was honestly such an amazing concept I couldn't believe it. I wish my apartment was decorated as nicely as the one I saw! He was super informative and patient and if my sister moves to NY I'm sure she will move into one of these apartments. I hope you bring Common to Florida soon!!"
16,5,"This review is for Lior.  She rocks!  She has made such a difference in the quality of our member events.  We love Lior!

"
17,5,Awesome apartment to live at! Last weekend we had a summer kick off bbq. So much fun hanging with my neighbors. Thank Melissa and Common for helping us with the budget for everything.
18,5,"If you're transitioning into a new city or just need a convenient and low maintenance living situation - Common is perfect for you. After living under the demands of reckless landlords, having everything online and with one company made things super simple. I love my roommates, the furnishings and the price point."
19,5,"A little over two weeks ago I moved into one of Common's suites in the new Cypress building. I came from another city, with only a video tour of the place before signing the lease. As anyone else in a similar situation, I expected to find numerous issues with the place once I rolled up to the door. It all seemed to good to be true! Yet... somehow, it has been even better than I could have imagined.

After getting to know Ridgewood and a few other Cypress members, I couldn't be happier with my decision to move into Common Cypress! The people here are kind, professional, and respectful. The amenities and open areas are INCREDIBLE, to say the least. Just today I found out we have an incredible rooftop! As a startup founder with a thousand different things on my mind, Common has removed a major stress point in my move to a new city.
"
20,5,"Great place to live if you know what you want. No need to buy furniture, on site dishwasher and laundry, regular cleaning...all of these things spell good times to me. I love living here."
21,5,"It's super cool to have wonderful gym, cinema and other facilities. And a lot of free events like cooking, painting classes, dining and even Hamilton show! Will definitely recommend to all my friends!"
22,5,"I lived in Common Pacific for two years and have nothing but good things to say! It was by far the easiest, most comfortable, and fun living experience I've ever had.

I compare this to moving into a traditional apartment, which I have been doing for over 10 years. In those situations, you have to navigate moving, furniture, utilities, roommates, cleaning schedules, etc. etc. and it takes up a ton of time, effort, and money.

Yes, the price point for Common is on the higher side, but everything is taken care of for you! Your rent includes the room, all utilities, once a week maid service, all supplies (such as TP, cleaning supplies, dishwasher detergent, and laundry detergent), and an activity fee for social get-togethers. The fact that I never had to spend time or energy on these things was invaluable.

Because of these services, they remove any roommate friction and I had a great relationship with all of them. Moreover, I knew most everyone in the whole building and became friends with many of them. Common often gets labeled as a dorm, but it's more like having the best parts of a dorm, which to me are the ease of living and the ability to make new friends without any of the bad such as the immaturity as most are in their late 20s/early 30s and inferior quality living quarters.

Speaking of which, the apartments are beautiful. The design and comfort are worth it. For example, all the rooms come with a Casper mattress, Parachute sheets, a down comforter, and lighting. Plus, we had a basement with a large work area, games, a movie projector, a beautiful private backyard, and a rooftop.

Lastly, the events are great. One of my favorites was a trip up to Storm King sculpture park. Once I rsvp'd, all I had to do was show up at the bus station on a Saturday. Common covered the cost of round-trip transportation and the admission fee. I had been wanting to go up but it's hard to find people and coordinate logistics, and Common made it so easy to do.

Only reason I moved out was because my girlfriend and I were looking to get our own place and Common doesn't have a great solution for couples. If they did, we would have definitely done that as she loves Common too!
"
23,5,"I live in a Common building in Brooklyn. Apartment is great with very friendly and efficient concierge and superintendant. Adriana is a fantastic cleaner and Lior is always great for tips, recommendations and events. Really enjoying my stay"
24,5,"Great service!

I appreciate everything Common does. Would definitely recommend to others.
"
25,5,"I love staying with Common as they are very supportive in terms of customer service and experience.

"
26,5,"I've lived in Common Chicago for a month now and absolutely love it. This is my first experience co-living (although I spent a year traveling the US as a digital nomad and often shared living quarters). Other than the road trip, I've lived alone for nearly 20 years so I was intrigued but a bit hesitant.
The space is beautiful and well decorated. I was mostly concerned about sharing the bathroom and kitchen. I share 2 1/2 baths with 4 other people, so that's never been an issue. And hardly anyone else on my floor cooks so I often have the kitchen to myself. There is even plenty of cupboard space. I've been lucky that my housemates keep the place clean and are respectful of everyone.
I work from home and was concerned that I wouldn't have enough space or peace and quiet. The opposite is true - I work in a gorgeous sun room and pretty much have the floor to myself during the day.
Finally, the common staff has been wonderful to deal with - very responsive to my questions and even added a bike rack inside the property after I made a request.
In short, I highly recommend both Common and co-living.
:-)
"
27,5,Common gives a great foundation to anyone looking for a community and a great place to get started in a new city. Melissa Turner at Common is a great experience manager and has great ideas to enhance the common community and experience. Highly recommend!
28,5,"Overall, Common made moving across the United States an absolute breeze. Having all furniture/supplies/hardware supplied and included in rent is an absolute stress reliever. Now that I've finally settled in New York City over the past two years, I'm moving on to explore other neighborhoods, but will always be an advocate for Common to people that are looking for the most seamless living experience offered in the city."
29,5,Stayed at 'Anew Terry' in Seattle for four months. Every member of Common Living staff was amazing in helping out and the events they hosted to connect neighbors in the same building were nothing short of spectacular. I loved my stay and their assistance solved any issues I had in no time.
30,5,"Common has been a really cool place to live. I like my roommates a lot, and everyone in my place has been pretty great. Was really the perfect way to move into a city since your home ends up being friendlier, between people cooking together or going out for a beer. My main gripe is that it was hard to figure out when things were happening, but then they just launched this community portal where it has a ton of events that they are planning and paying for for us, so that's pretty dope and why I'm giving 5stars and not 4!

"
31,5,"Applying to Common ended up being super easy. I needed a new place after a breakup. I applied online and was able to tour really quickly.

That New Yorker article describes Common as dorms for adults but it was just like living with a bunch of other chill young professionals. I had plenty of privacy with my private bedroom and made friends with the people in my building who also love indie movies.

The home itself was super nice and furnished which is just what I needed. While price point seemed a little high at first, I ended up saving a bunch of money by not having to buy furniture and all they supplies they provide.

Moved out for grad school in another city, but hoping Common opens up there too soon!"
32,5,"Toured their apartments when I was looking to move. Although I didn't end up moving to the city, I was really impressed by how clean and beautiful the apartments were and how attentive their staff was. Quick turn around times, easy touring, and a nice place to live. When I toured, I was able to see a couple of members there at the home, and they were all pretty happy. I'd be stoked to live there if I ended up in a city they are in."
33,5,"Common puts your average city landlord to shame. As a girl in the city, it's hard to always trust supers but their property service team is quick, communicative, and do a good job, and I feel safe in my apartment because of it.

"
34,5,Since I moved into one of Common's homes life has just been so much simpler. All of the little inconveniences I've had with roomies in the past is nonexistent at Common. I don't need to worry about whose turn it is to buy the cleaning supplies or hassle with anyone about splitting the bills. I feel safe and overall less stressed. I would definitely recommend living here for any young professional who enjoys a relaxed life around some really nice people.
35,5,"I've lived in one of the Common homes for the last 4 months and it was such an easy transition for me when moving to a new city. I was super overwhelmed to move, but their team was super helpful from the start AND IT'S FULLY FURNISHED! I could have never decorated this nicely on my own! I definitely recommend living here!"
36,5,"Thoroughly enjoyable experience living at Common Havermeyer last summer in Brooklyn. The house was beautiful and well furnished, and my room was large. It is a great community and have made friends for life!"
37,5,"Common has been an amazing place to call home for almost two years now. During my first year, I spent the first half living in Common's NYC Williamsburg location and then transferred to one of the locations in San Francisco for the duration of my lease. Common makes it really seamless to do this, and since coliving rooms are fully furnished, all I had to do was move a few suitcases. Some highlights are the gorgeous community spaces which are different in each building- for example, in Williamsburg there is a fitness room and also a huge movie room where people would gather to watch movies every weekend. In SF, I really enjoyed cooking with roommates in our extra large kitchen and many people used the downstairs lounge area for working. And both had great rooftops, of course!

I really liked my roommates and have kept in touch with many of them. At Common there is pretty much always something going on that you can get involved in, but there is never any pressure to do so. Everyone is on slack and people are fairly active, and you'll often see invitations in your building's channel to go out and check out a new restaurant, or go hiking outside the city, or just hang out downstairs and watch GOT. It's cool to just have an instant network to be plugged in to.

Lastly, I really appreciate the people who work at Common- they are super friendly and easy to contact via email. You get a human response pretty quickly and they always follow up to make sure the repair got done (or whatever you requested)...it's a much more seamless process than with any other residential building I've ever lived in.

38,5,"I've now lived in Common in New York, New York (Pacific) and Oakland, California (MacArthur).  The pictures in this review are from Pacific, where I first lived.  Highlights include weekly cleaners, Android TV or Roku, Nest, Sonos, 100Mbps Internet, Cisco Meraki or Ubiquiti APs (with -60dBm coverage or better), free washers/dryers, Casper bed, Parachute bed sheets, nice utensils and furniture, keyless entry (mobile or card), Slack, Stripe, emergency support numbers, exclusive monthly events, informal get togethers, and more.  Amenities and offerings were similar in MacArthur, although the house structure and neighborhood differed; I'd encourage you to spend some time in your potential neighborhood before signing a lease, if possible.  I've overall had a positive experience and if it weren't for some personal situations (a mix of life, financial, and career), I might still be living in Common.  Most amazingly, I met my significant other in Common, we're now coming up on two years, and things are going really well!

There's a lot to like about Common, from the convenience, to the community.  The community aspect often seems less relevant when first considering housing in a city (at least it was for me) but it ended up being the thing that I actually liked most about Common.  You get an instant network of friends, and my hope is that the emphasis Common placed on fostering a sense of community through weekly and monthly events, continues well into the future.

Although this is a positive review, I can't say that everything during my time was perfect.  For example, there were multiple instances where there was confusion around how to handle moving on from Common (if you end up deciding to do so).  My genuine hope and sense is that the issues I had (e.g., the person I was communicating with did not have accurate information, or was unable to relay accurate information to me, or there was ambiguity in the lease or membership agreement) were due to a case of growing pains, because when I did escalate my issues to someone more senior, they were immediately and properly handled.  Moreover, someone each time went out of his or her way to ensure those things were properly resolved.  I really appreciated that and it meant a lot.

If you are considering co-living arrangements, I'd highly encourage you to at least consider Common, depending on if it's a fit for you and Common.  I think the founder and much of the team are big believers in the future of co-living, and my hope is they continue to focus on community, and as much as possible, flexibility with regard to housing and membership options for everyone living in Common.  I've enjoyed my time being part of this community, and if my girlfriend and I end up together, a big part will be because Common brought us together."
