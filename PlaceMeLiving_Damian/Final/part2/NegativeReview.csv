Lau Yu,placeme,"they didn't say before I booked and stayed for 30 days is this room was going to be into a 4 bedroom apartment, with no living room or common area, 1 bathroom and I am not planning as a traveler and professional to live this way because on one side they want to sell they rent comfort and convenience, but they don't deliver this as there are no linens, pillow or comforter, toilet paper or simple stuff to do life again =comfortable and convenient=
My room was hell hot and hell cold, couldn't they solve the issue of heat/AC? or fix the bathroom when it was leaking water before we all arrived? You could even feel the room and the whole apartment moving through any wind or big truck driving through the street. They use to say they would come into the apartment to clean but the bathroom was never clean even if they would place it in the tag on the fridge. I don't think Placeme shows control of what are they renting. They even sub-rented rooms when others had the room for the rest of the month. I OPENLY DO NOT recommend Place.me.
I am SURE the other reviews must be paid.  The roomates and friends used to talk about it because they had a deal from our company, we all hated to stay here!"
Piotr Kala,placeme,"1. PlaceMe crew along with Clara where walking into our apartment multiple times without previous notice. Even after we specifically said we do not like that - it was still happening.
2. PlaceMe advertised that they will provide paper towels / toilet paper etc. However, after few months it stopped. After I asked Clara about it - she let me know that it is not obligatory for them - the may do it but they don't have to
3. I feel like Clara's tone while speaking to the clients was hostile and disrespectful.
4. This deal is ok if you want to live with random people that change very 3 months. The age in our house was 20-50 which makes it little bit more difficult to get along with each other."
Melina L.K.,placeme,"Though it is convenient, the management of this companies at times has seriously ridiculous expectations. Be prepared to pay more during winter months for heating! As they basically expect you to be gone from the apartment all day with it not being heated (at all) as they are unreasonable in terms of what they accept as an electricity bill. Also: they suggested us to leave bedroom doors open, in order to save on the electric heating bill (they seem to not have a sense of privacy!). 
Unfortunately one cannot lock individual bedroom doors either. 
Furthermore, it happened to us that they forgot to pay the bill, hence our internet service stopped working!"
Grant Gary,bedly,"Company was great, I got a great apartment move in and everything was smooth. I am to move out of this unit and suppose to move to another location end of this month. But they must have gone out of business or something because no one has answered emails or calls in over a week. So now I have to find a different place to live. If they aren’t out of business someone should answer the phone or email back. As I am trying to sign a new lease."
"
Muhamad Naqshbandi",bedly,One of the least accommodating customer services I have ever experienced. After giving me a room that was infested with bed bugs they don’t even provide a temporary location for me to sleep in until they resolve the issue. So now I have to either spend money on a place to live with no refund or continue living with the bed bugs they’ve graciously given to keep me company
Casey Lunkley,bedly,"New management has ruined Bedly. I sent an email to inquire about an apartment and they didn't even bother to email me a response. 
If they can't even answer your questions when you're looking to give them money, I don't think it's going to be a good experience once they have you in a lease."
Ramon Johnson,bedly,"I've enjoyed using Bedly as a new resident in NY. They are a wonderful resource for young professionals who are seeking affordable housing. The living spaces are aesthetically pleasing  and the fully furnished living spaces are convenient for individuals who may want to save money. However, the support team could be a little more prompt when responding to questions or concerns of their customers."
Blake Shetter,bedly,"I've been a Bedly ""member"" for over a year now. The apartment I'm in is nice, roommates are great and the price is reasonable. But when you need to deal with Bedly support team or sales team you're lucky if you get a reply and you feel like you've won the lottery if they do something in a timely manner. 
For the last month I've been trying to contact them to sign a new lease. Adam stopped responding and Blaine never responded to begin with.
You may ask ""why are you signing a lease when you're unhappy?"" and that's a great question that I asked myself. The answer is simple. Price & flexibility. That's it. 
In the past it took months to get Bedly/the building owner to fix a leak in my room (they never fixed it, the city of NY actually did). 
In another case It took 5 days to send out a plumber for low water pressure. 
All in all, Bedly is a great idea but the management and staff are either overworked and unable to keep up or they just don't care. Renter beware."
Sabastian Piedmont,bedly,"I moved into a place off the Vernon Ave JMZ stop. Paid, moved in, etc. my first Saturday in the apartment the owner of the building began showing the apartment while I was in it. Yelled at me saying, “Who the f*** are you? Why are you here?” He called bedly and said everything was worked out. I also showed the apartment to other persons and was promised seamless gift cards I never received. Well, the weekend before winter storm Jonas I’m told by Bedly that I need to be out. I’m a student teacher at the time and in a tough bind. The CEO/owner offered me to stay in his apartment then move me into a more expensive place in Washington Heights. I ended up feeling uncomfortable doing that (which is pretty reasonable, especially after the shenanigans). So I ended up having to get a ride out of the city the Sunday AM of the storm. On my way back to WNY I’m told they were able to get a few extra days for me to stay from the landlord. I wasn’t refunded a full amount. Which I understand. But I never was given an explanation of how Bedly moved me into an apartment that they were obviously not finalized with. I may be wrong about what happened. Thankfully my student teaching placement was able to be switched after trips to both the admin and school that could possibly have me. The experience cost me over a thousand dollars, probably near two K in wasted money. The entire time I was in the dark. Just moved to the city. Called 311 because both the heat was out during the storm and me essentially being ordered to leave during the storm. I’ve never had an explanation and it cost me a large sum of money. It seems they are on top of things now. I just have wanted an explanation and they never removed me from their emails explaining of how great they are. It’s just worrisome. I’m sure it’s great now. But moving 21 year olds into an apartment not from the city when obviously they didn’t have permission is bizarre. They even took 360 degree photos while I was there and had every room listed. Etc. I was half naked getting in the shower when the landlord arrived. It was a very intense, scary, and unreasonable experience. Were my payments given to the owner of the apartment or kept by Bedly if they could never move anyone in? If it’s all good now the customer service aspects were great when all was well. When this went down the owner/CEO was in Boston and not answering my calls or texts. Disheartening experience."
Adriano Yoshino,bedly,"I'm loving Bedly, it is easy and simple to book and the houses are new and well equipped (good kitchen, laundromat...). No complaints about the house and my experience living there. 
The only thing I would improve is the customer service that sometimes take a while to get get back."
Whipload Channel,bedly,"I've rented from bedly twice (in Boston).  The first experience for 1 month was good.  The second wasn't.  The room was advertised on their site as having locks+key on the doors.  Seems a no brainer for a house with many occupants.  When I move in, they've removed the locks.  The reason they did this was a fire violation.  Bedly didn't update the listing before my move-in date.  Their response to this has been ""We're sorry this has been such a big issue for you.""  I haven't been able to stay at my 6-month rental (which I'm still paying for since Bedly has Zero Cancellations policy) because I have things that are too expensive to keep in an unlocked room in Boston.  The company puts no effort into fixing their own mistakes and is OK with ripping off customers.  2019
As others have mentioned, getting hold of Bedly representatives is very difficult.  Expect many tries.  On the other hand, Bedly will gladly spam you with emails."
Malak Saleh,bedly,Bedly is a great solution to housing in NYC. The room comes furnished and utilities are included in the bill. The bedly staff are very quick with responses and do an amazing job of keeping you updated on all that you need to know.
Rachel Wilbers,bedly,"With it being my first time living in NYC, I am happy I found Bedly. It was easy to be approved and to find a location suitable for me. I felt comfortable and safe in my apartment. There were a few kinks to be worked out when I first moved in, but customer service was able to resolve them in no time. I will be using Bedly in the future. I just wish they were located all over the US because I travel for work!"
Sofia. Claudino,bedly,"Someone was supposed to come and fix it but they never finished the work.
In the pictures you can see how much work has to be done yet. 
I can not even take advantage of the space in the room. I am here for 1 month now and the room is definitely NOT what was adversitized to me which is totally illegal:
- Leak in the room (was actually raining inside and it ruined my furniture)
- AC is not working
- Shower in the bath needs to be fixed
This room should not have a single person on it until it is properly fixed!This is not the room that I signed a contract!
Having said, I am still waiting for my discount on my first month 1,100$ rent or I will cancel my contract.
At this point I would NOT recommend bedly to anyone.
-----
Adding a new review due to change of facts:
The bedroom is totally fixed now which means it is not leaking, the walls were secured, shower is working properly and also AC.
It does feel like a decent bedroom now and I can finally be at peace.
Also stating that after me insisting on the matter, Bedly finally made me a generous discount due to this situation which seems pretty fair to me and now I can for sure close this matter.
The costumer service was always accessible, specially Paul how would reply almost immediately to my emails, so they were hands by hands with the case and communicating any developments.At this point I would recommend Bedly services to my closest friends!
Thanks!"
Stephanie Felix,bedly,"Sent an email well over a week ago with simple questions about one of the properties, received a generic response (ignoring the questions) and have sent several follow up emails and texts since then with no response.
My questions were basic like size of the room, is the lease contracted with a landlord or Bedly, who owns the apartment, is there a floor plan, current roommates? None of the questions have received a response
I hope this isn’t a scam. The reviews I see are scary and they look like the may manage some good spaces. If they aren’t ready to really run this company I hope they let those apartments go so people can rent them through less sketchy means."
William Thompson,bedly,"Bedly housing units look nice online, however the units can sometimes be every small. You must also pay a $500 dollar memeber fee which is explained as one time, but I’m sure one time will be the only time you would use bedly. The rent can be pretty high which would incline you to look for your own apartment. The customer service also is not the best."
mengyang fan,bedly,"This is the first time I live in a Bedly maintained room. Really a nice and pleasant experience. The room was clean and spacious when I came in. The kitchen is the best part and microwave oven, refrigerator, gas, etc. made me enjoy cooking during my stay. Basically my room and public area are well maintained and I really enjoyed. The only suggestion is about the check-in process. I think Bedly logo should be attached on the door leading to the second floor so that guests would not be confused which door to open after they pass the front door. I tried the key on the wrong door at first."
Trevor Batchelder,bedly,"I lived in an apartment that was previously managed by Colivo. They were tolerable landlords at best, however when Bedly took over, everything went downhill.
Customer service was constantly poor. Whenever I had to call to voice a concern or speak to someone about a maintenance issue, it was near impossible to get ahold of anyone - much less get a straight answer out of anyone. For a period I believe that the work order request on the website was not functional and tenants were not notified.
Maintenance workers entered the apartment without notice on numerous occasions, despite my and my fellow tenants' voiced disapproval. Employees were defiant and one even cited an incorrect lease and told me ""I don’t know what else to tell you... these are the confines in which I’m working.""
On top of it all, my security deposit was not delivered in a timely manner.
Bedly utterly lacks the expertise to manage rental properties and should be avoided at all costs."
Monica Samir Kumta,bedly,"Experience with Bedly was great. The apartment was well furnished and well connected to the city. A small downside is that the Apartment has rats and even though the walls were sealed, we still continued to have the problem."
Geraldine Nabeta,bedly,This company is out of business - do not let them fool you
,bedly,"Thus far, the 2 weeks I have lived in a Bedly apartment have been an absolute nightmare. In the past 14 days, I have experienced multiple issues with parking, flooding in the basement, loss of all water to the apartment for a day, loss of hot water for a week, internet connectivity issues, and multiple items missing from the ""fully furnished [and] stocked"" apartment. 
To begin, they advertise parking at my site as a 6/10; however, all parking requires a permit; meaning I had the choice of re-registering my vehicle for a short term stay for over $500, or paying out of pocket in addition to rent for a spot I needed to find and rent myself separately. When I reached out to them about this issue and the false advertising on their website, they didn't respond for over 5 days (every one of which I emailed them to follow up).
Next, when I went to take out the recycling in my building, I checked into the basement to find 2 inches of standing water they were completely unaware of. I'm unsure of how long it had been there, or how long it would have remained had I not notified them. In response, they shut off all water to our apartment at 7:00 PM on a weeknight in August, leaving us with no usable drinking water, unable to shower, and unable to use our bathroom until late the following day. It then took them an additional week to restore hot water to our site, and our shower still does not have hot water to date. 
Additionally, I have had to reach out to them almost daily for basic necessities in our ""fully stocked"" kitchen. Our dishwasher appears to be broken, our dryer requires multiple cycles to dry a single load. And our internet has been cutting out every few minutes for the past 12 hours. 
Bedly requests residents pay exorbitantly for apartments that are teeming with issues, their customer service is horrendous, and to say they fail to live up to their promises would be generous. My advice is to avoid booking through Bedly at all costs."
Ahmad,bedly,"The service provided by bedly is truly excellent. The benefits of having a short-term place without paying thousands of $$ for hotels is great. Specially when it comes to Boston and NYC. One thing though, they should have a clear check-in, check-out policy."
Brown Quentin,bedly,"As soon as you pay for the service, the hosts become elusive. Blaine is a ghost and so are the other “hosts”."
Dana,bedly,"I have been using bedly in Boston area for almost 2 months now. They are definitely growing as a company, but their website is terrible. I had 2 accounts created and their login doesn't work all the time. Their Facebook authentication is broken and I am unable to log into my current account. Plus the rooms and units are usually worst than they depict it on their site. I would be ok if it were just an Airbnb, but because you sign a lease...it makes it harder to leave so quickly."
Morgan Duncan,bedly,Still waiting to hear back.....
Yhenew ,bedly,Total garbage. They didn’t clean the room before I moved in. There are bugs/scabies/mites in the bed I couldn’t sleep. They said they would transfer me to a different room and I submitted request but they booked the room I requested to transfer to. I’m stuck being eaten by bugs. Completely dishonest and disrespectful support team. They reply to inquiries after a week. They don’t clean the common areas. Stinky. Wouldn’t recommend at all.
Chris Hammon,bedly,"I've had some time to reflect, and while I'm annoyed at the incredibly sensitive and loud fire alarm, it's really not a deal breaker. The apt is nice for the most part. They're a startup so they're working things out while they go. Besides the fire alarm, my only real problem is that we very rarely get notified when strangers will be in our apt. They show it all the time without notifying us, and while I was gone over thanksgiving someone moved into our apartment (we were given no notification) and I caught him on camera entering my room. Thankfully he wasn't looking to steal, just be generally nosy, which is still fairly concerning but not the worst thing in the world. 
I've revised my review to 4 stars. I'll give them 5 when they fix the email notification problem."
Rachael Batchelor,bedly,"I moved to Boston for a 6 month work experience and needed a place with a flexible and short term leasing option. The apartment looks exactly as described in the photos online, it's furnished, well-built, and my room is fairly spacious. The biweekly cleaning is convenient and the communication emails for when the cleaning staff is coming, or a new roommate is moving in is great. Also, in September, they offered me an invite to a Red Sox game with the first drink on them and a Bedly Happy Hour to introduce their tenants to each other. I didn't attend do to work obligations and time constraints, but it's a nice touch for them to reach out like that.
Why I'm only giving 3 stars: like other reviewers, too often I had to ask the Bedly team to fix things they should have known (i.e. 2 inches of water in the basement, lack of kitchen/bathroom supplies, poor water pressure and no hot water for a day, faulty washer/dryer, etc). However, when I did reach out, for things such as: locked out of apartment, desk chair leg not screwed on prior to arrival, broken shower rod from a drunk roommate ripping it down, parking permit in MA, fruit flies from roommate leaving excessive trash and food out for days while other roommates were away, washer/dryer issues, personal lock on door, they always answered and in a reasonable amount of time. 
I do not like that they don't change the unit/apartment codes once a roommate leaves as anyone who has lived there before can come back whenever they want. It's also unfortunate that they don't have locks on the individual rooms, even though one of my roommates mentioned this concern and nothing was done about it. I reached out about halfway through my stay to see if a personal lock could be installed and they told me they couldn't due to safety measures. The wi-fi is OK, not super fast and more often than I'd like I need to disconnect and reconnect. The furniture is decent, you can tell it's cheap IKEA furniture, but for the situation it's okay. Our smoke alarm has gone off randomly for only 30 seconds, leaving us fairly confused. I needed to reach out multiple times to have them supply fruit fly traps for us, and they took a week to come inspect the apartment in the first place which seemed like a serious health concern to me. I reached out about the washer/dryer being faulty and shutting off 5 minutes into the cycle, but these appliances look brand new and should be working perfectly. They had someone come in and look at the machines; the tech said the machines worked fine and I insisted they check again. When they checked thoroughly the second time they realized the issue and the machines work well now. However, the washer doesn't register the cold water setting, but that's not much of a concern for me right now. 
This is all I can think of right now, but if more comes up I will edit my review. I will also review and revise at the end of my lease!
Would I recommend them to others and/or live in a Bedly unit again? Yeah, but only if I'm in the unique situation of needing a short term flexible lease in a new state again, and I would try to find other options first."
Lily Zhou,bedly,"I love finding cool startups that fill a needed niche and when I found bedly when I needed a 2 month stay in Boston, I was SUPER excited. The website was easy to navigate and email communication prior to leasing was great. Living there was a nightmare!! 
1.       I get there during a heat wave with all my stuff to realize I got the WRONG check in information and had to wait an hour on the street in 90 deg heat until I finally got through to someone at the company
2.       Inside, the walls had holes which are literally masking taped over. The paint is chipped and peeling all over. There is tape over a light switch and no overhead lighting. The room was super humid as to be unliveable without an AC.
3.       The house was being sold and I had no idea until I walked out of the shower in a towel to be greeted by strangers led by a realtor. Someone then came by to film the apartment and all my stuff when I was away. Thus began a train of people randomly dropping by. I would occasionally be emailed ahead of time but often not. One time, a contractor walked into my room while I was napping without any warning…..

4.       The laundry and dishwasher have been broken for the entire two months despite me and the housemates emailing multiple times in turn

5.       When the house sold, before closing, they are kicking everyone else out who still had leases without offering alternative accommodations.  

I would recommend to NEVER give any money to this company. For 75% of the price I paid, tons of my classmates had much better subleases… This was such a disappointing experiencing."
Nadine Hart,bedly,"I wouldn’t even recommend this to my arch nemesis. The people who work here clearly have no idea how to do their jobs and their manner is appalling. Despite me, and my roommates, getting annoyed that Bedly would turn up unannounced they completely ignored us and left us for three months with a leak in the ceiling. I slipped and was hurt but they didn’t seem to give a damn. I could go on and on about how unprofessional and downright dangerous these foolish people are but they attempted to keep my deposit on the grounds of not paying my last month’s rent despite me showing them proof from my bank that said otherwise. I would’ve said keep it and make a better company but I needed it.
Stay away from this company. They only care for your money not your safety or comfort."
Chris Herbs,bedly,"Bedly cancelled my rental only days before I was supposed to move from NY to Boston, leaving me in limbo. Their sales rep and support team has been completely unresponsive since they cancelled on me. They were very responsive when they were trying to talk me into signing a year lease, months ago, however. Seems like a scam. Don’t use them."
Evelia C.,bungalow,"Moving in was a bit hectic for me and my family, due to certain situations however michelle was always on top of everything keeping me updated as well as salina. If anything changed before we moved in i would get a call about the change. Leasing staff were very patient and also amazingly nice .  Joe was very informative when it came to the place and showing us around. Place looks like a little house, which we like."
Blanca A.,bungalow,"We faced a few obstacles while moving in but, but Michelle and Chris were extremely helpful and would address our concerns right away. Michelle made herself available at all times and would follow up with us. The maintenance staff is also friendly and willing to help. The staff definitely wants to make you feel at home. Michelle accommodated to us as best as she and her staff could. I would not hesitate to ask her for any questions or help. 

In regards to the apt/house, what won us over was that it came with a fridge, washer, dryer, and stove. We were also able to get two parking spaces, we pay for one, because only 1 is given to the apt/house. The staff is working to improve the community and I look forward to seeing the changes."
Lilly T.,bungalow,"This has to be THE worse place to rent an apartment in Garden Grove.  Management is horrible and there is a new manager every week.  My car,  was towed,  broken into, and the car port literally fell on the hood of my car and NOBODY even tried to contact me,  instead they did a horrible job at trying to clean it up.  There is dog poop EVERYWHERE and dogs constantly running around loose (I have a service animal) trying to start fights with other dogs.  There is Mold in my unit that i've reported for MONTHS now that has been completely ignored, and there is NO parking for your guests PERIOD! As a matter of fact,  the back gates that lead to the ONLY street where you can park, have been welded shut and the are kids that jump the giant fence daily!! That is sooooo dangerous it's crazy and god only knows what their plan of evacuation is in case of a fire since there is only one way in and one way out now.  I hope that no more hard working honest people have to pay to live this horrendous experience.  I will be updating this review with photos proving everything i've mentioned here in just a bit, and I will provide photos so everyone can see the truth and not assume i'm making any of this up."
Bern N.,bungalow,"Here are the MAJOR problems to make it easier to read:
1. Cockroach infestation, that will never go away even with treatments
2. Very poor insulation, hence the ""bungalows"".. Temps go as high as 100F inside. AC wall unit cannot keep up w/ the rising temp during the summer. You can feel the heat coming through the walls and radiating from the ceiling. You can feel the cold coming through the windows
3. Loud community, a lot of children, and cars playing loud music driving by
4. A lot of noise in the middle of the night, even when we reported a noise complaint, we continue to hear people partying till 2AM.
5. Manager changes every month, we would have to start over and tell every new manager of our ongoing issues, because it would not be passed on to the new oncoming manager."
Yuri P.,bungalow,I wish I could've paid attention to this reviews. I have lived in other apartments and I've never experience a bad experience like this one. I promise you when you walk in the apartment looks good and clean. The first month until the end of the lease the apartment was infested with Roaches. The exterminator was out here and it did not work. I would die every time I would open the kitchen cabinets and a roach would fall on me. I would literally scream everyday. The parking lot is horrible everyone fights over 4 visiting parking spaces there's people that will never move there cars. Then if you have visitors and you leave them your parking space they will tow there car. Or your car. I couldn't ever live peaceful in this place. I'm happy now that I've moved out.
Brownen P.,bungalow,"unsure why representative responds to yelp comments.  maybe she should tackle roach issues instead of typing bologna.
seriously... these people post up in office instead if picking up dog poop and trash!  r-o-a-c-h  city apartments should be new name.  and  they will take your deposit to pay orkin.  
sad utah based company.
class action law suit is is what bungalow  requires.. tear this  place down.....demolish for community!"
Mika M.,bungalow,Management changed 3 times in 2 years and every the new manager is more rude than the previous! ROACHES are everywhere!!!
Lesia L.,bungalow,"It has been a very unpleasant experience since the day we signed our lease. After 2 weeks here we started discussing how to get out of our lease and have been looking for a new place. We find reasons to not go ""home"". Cars get towed, stuff gets stolen, trash overflowing...
You only get one parking spot, the other is rented for a very high amount. Absolutely NO parking for guests, not that I want them to come over anyway - I'm too embarassed. Why you might ask? because it is roach infested (even after several sprays) and noisy and the quality of the inside is poor.
Paint peeling, plumbing problems (been ""fixed"" several times) and it's ALWAYS hot inside. They are redoing some of the apts on the inside. And the entire outside is being redone very nicely (colors are UGLY!)but still look much better than before. I was told new windows in May, we just got ours in July - and they didn't even let us know they would be entering in the apt to do this work!
I'm going to stop the rant now or I will go forever. But be warned - look elsewhere."
Karla T.,bungalow,if anything this palce a shit hole do not move here car jacking mad office manager that screams at people it looks pretty but then when u start living there its like a total nightmare bugs every where dirty pool trash cans overfilled no parking new management suck big time
George D.,bungalow,"We've been living here a month, its a nice house, but you are totally on your own, Bungalow will always do the bare minimum they can for you. Alyssa and the rest of the Support team are totally inept."
Dee A.,bungalow,"We did not renew our lease here and I will list out the pros and cons: 

PROS:
-flexible & understanding management (Michelle)
-never had issues with neighbors 
-maintenance tries their best to keep areas clean
-easy application process

CONS:
-too many children for my liking (they are always on our stairs and leave trash, toys, drop food, etc.)
-dumpsters become overloaded with trash and makes the apartments look older and dirty ( I get embarrased when visitors come over)
-people don't pick up after their pets. Large loads  everywhere.
-no enforcement on the homeless who are searching through the dumpsters every SINGLE morning and night
-asked to get AC and fan above stove fixed many times ( I lost count) and it was never fixed
-parking sucks (but to be fair, that's almost everywhere in OC)
-no jacuzzi
-gym is not 24 hours ; minimal equipment
-buildings look old and the graffitti on the back walls don't make it look any better 
-trash prices are insanely high because people are always dumping their furniture out (there is old shitty furniture by the dumpsters everyday, it makes the complex look worse)."
Michelle R.,bungalow,"My stay here overall was great. I loved my apartment. It was secluded and very private. Michelle the manager has turned this place around. The communication has been great with her. She is always on top of it all. She has definitely put things in order and has changed up the place. The few issues I have with the complex I understand are not in her control like the homeless that get into the dumpsters and make a mess. So you have to take matters into your own hands at 3am and kick out the homeless from the complex. Other than that, a lot of families no issues. Everyone is in their own world and very pet friendly. The gym equipment is broken and never got fixed so that was a bummer. . Other than that, my stay here was great. Very relaxing. I love all the grass areas.. I just laid out a blanket and read a book. This place is great for families."
Crew J.,bungalow,"Filthy cockroach infested get
Your
Car towed at its assigned spot management is
Horrible this place should be condemned! Even with 100% proof that I should've been paid back for the tow from DTS towing The property manager who was a total bitch gave zero shits about me and my family or my money and denied my claim I think you and your Bungalo apartments are one of the scum of the earth and I hope you all burn in hell"
Cole F.,bungalow,"Living in these apartments are very hypocritical due to the people living here with minimal parking spaces. There are people parked outside of the apartment complex and park on the red curb which aren't able to park and don't get towed. Yet my car parked in the visitors parking which means anyone is able to park there which people from the apartment complex park there and leave overnight. Never do they get towed and my car gets towed. I am a full time college student which I'm unemployed at the moment, I can't be able to pay for my car to be freed. And without giving me any notices or say if I can move my car, giving me a warning would've been great. My car was towed on the same day I was getting back to school which I was going to move it elsewhere but I had to go do homework for my classes."
