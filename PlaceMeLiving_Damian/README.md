## Project Deliverables

### Project Deliverable 0

Teams should have met with their client, reviewed the project scope, and submitted a pull request with the revised and final project description. Project descriptions should include data sources that your team will collect, including any additional datasets you identify that you think would enhance the project, specific questions that will be answered and the step by step approach you will take for transforming the data (cleaning) and answering strategic questions.

### Project Deliverable 1

ALL data should have been collected. Your team should perform a preliminary analysis of the data and attempt to answer one question relevant to your project proposal which you will submit as a pull request.

### Project Deliverable 2

All project questions should have been reviewed, answered, and submitted in a written document outlining findings as a PR. You will also be asked to submit the associated data and a README explaining what each label/feature in your dataset represents. Your team should meet with the client before this deliverable.

### Project Deliverable 3

This is a draft of your final report that has been reviewed by your client. It includes all visualizations, results, data, and code up to this point, along with proper documentation on how to reproduce your results, compile and use your codebase, and navigate your dataset. Your team will submit this as a PR.

### Final Project Deliverable

This should be an enhancement of deliverable 3.
