Michaela Marie,5,With my first time moving to NYC I am happy I found out about Bedly. They have been very helpful with any questions I have and reliable throughout out the whole process!
Jasmine Ferguson,5,I stayed with Bedly for 2 months and my overall experience was great. The room was just as described and pictured and they even allowed me to tour before I moved in. Customer service was quick to respond to any of my questions/concerns and communication almost effortless. I would definitely use their service again.

Christopher Nocera,5,"My experience with bedly has been great. Their website is very clear and organized and made the apartment search very painless. In addition, Jake was a great agent and really went out of his way to make the process as smooth as possible. Would highly recommend!"
Danny Ginzburg,5,"Bedly is a bit disorganized, but friendly enough. The apartment is pretty nice for the price. Two new bathrooms shared by 3 people is nice, as well as laundry in the building."
priti mayekar,5,"I loved my stay in this lovely peaceful home! I loved the comfy beds, the clean bathrooms, kitchen etc.  
Thanks so much for providing such a warm and wonderful place to stay while in Jersey city. Easy access and convenient to both central Avenue and JFK. What more could you ask for? It felt like a little home away from home. 
I cant wait to come back!"
Nicole Stephenson,5,Amazing situation. Community staff is attentive and accommodating. Easily a great situation for the short or long term. Apartments are amazing. Not like other places where your forced to be secluded to your room all day.
Malak Noor Saleh,5,"I would recommend bedly to my own family and friends. The stress of finding furniture is eliminated with Bedly, the support team is easily reachable and extremely responsive, and most importantly they list places with reasonable prices in New York especially. The bedly staff is super accommodating and professional."
Brian Kotowski,5,I used Bedly when I got promoted and moved to Boston for six months. It was a great experience. All my roommates were nice and everyone mostly kept to themselves. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a short term housing situation!
Julie,5,"When deciding to move out for the first time, I never thought about renting a room in a house... but then I came across Bedly ! Reviews were great and once I contacted them, customer service was amazing and everyone that helped me at Bedly have been very friendly and accommodating. Moving out was so easy because furniture was already provided and kitchen appliances were already there. I have even recommended Bedly to some of my friends. So happy that I decided to rent with Bedly."
Jacob Acton,5,"Great service for renting easily in NYC. They have apartments throughout Brooklyn and in the Upper East Side and Harlem, probably the coolest part of this service is that you can switch between available rooms at any time. The rent is laid out so it is easy to understand and all utilities are included, usually including a biweekly maid service. Roommates are random, which can lead to some weirdos, but it's NYC so. Rooms also tend to be small and units tend to have a 3:1 bedroom to bathroom ratio. There are some really good rooms, but if you want to get them cheap you need to look pretty far in advance. Overall, this website makes living in NYC seem easy."
Bogdan Molchanov,5,"I was on a 6 months visit to NJ from EU, seeking for accommodation options. Bedly turned out to be just the right place for me. The process was very fast and smooth even though I applied on a short notice and had no credit history in the US. 
The houses are very nice and cozy with spacious kitchens and nicely furnished rooms. Some rooms have beautiful backyards or common rooms and parking spaces. 
Finally, the roomies I've met are all interesting people and have all become my friends eventually. I have referred two of my friends to bedly and both of them took the apartments and told me they were satisfied."
Kisalaya Prasad,5,"Very good service for short term rentals. Easy to find book and pay. Customer service was always helpful, and the house was clean. Would use it again in the future."
Maleo Dillet,5,Co-living redefined. Nice and attentive staff members that make you feel right at home.
Hallie Neely,5,"Bedly is great! It was a great way to start my post-grad life in the city. A great, furnished room with all amenities (my apartment had a backyard as well, and both Bedly apartments I've rented from had private entrances to my room -- a HUGE plus.) Their staff is quick to reply via email, and their customer service people have ben helpful when a phone call was needed. Stress-free, trouble-free, and very accommodating. Would recommend to anyone wanting a room in NYC."
Ji Young Kim,5,"I don't know about other people's experience with Bedly, but as far as my experience is concerned, it's been great for the most part. I've been a member of Bedly since July 2017. I have to admit that the communication back then (only through e-mail) was a bit wonky and had a lot of room for improvement. But they updated their website's dashboard about a few months ago, they provided a resident an option to submit a request ticket for a various concerns — from maintenance to rent extension, etc — through the dashboard. Now the customer service people are more responsive to a various requests, and solving problems a lot faster. Even before then, it worked for me. Finding a decent, recently renovated apartment in NY without having to go through all those headache-inducing credit and other messy background checks, apartment coming fully furnished, all the other utilities costs and bi-monthly cleaning cost included in rent... it all worked alright for me. Keep up the good work!"
Beth Thorne,5,"Very easy process from booking to check out. Customer service is very responsive. The apartment itself was great and exactly what I needed for a few months long stay in NYC, room was exactly as listed online. I was skeptical when I booked but Bedly have met and exceeded all expectations!"
Hannah Hicks,5,"Loved Bedly! Had to find a sublet with pretty short notice and was very unhappy with every option I could find...then I found Bedly! I had recently moved to NYC so I still didn’t have a lot of furniture, so this was such an easy transition into really living here. The amenities were amazing, fully furnished and the cleaning was wonderful! Also the roommates I had were treasures. We got so lucky and became great friends. I was able to come home from work to the best possible living situation in light of not knowing many people in New York and needing to find a living situation."
ellen Wuest,5,"I wish Bedly was in every city. I move around a few times a year for work and Bedly makes moving into a new area as easy as possible with internet, heating/AC, utilities, furniture and dishes/etc ready for you on day 1. They are also super helpful if there are any additional needs and follow up with any issues until it is resolved. They sometimes have fun happy hours in the city."
Khyrie Jones,5,"As a young doctor moving to NYC from out-of-state, my goal was to affordably and comfortably live as close as possible to my hospitals of employment. Bedly made the moving process smooth and easy, and their customer service and other ancillary staff were very patient and accommodating of my work schedule. Furthermore, my roommates have always been great, and the Bedly social events are a great way to network or meet people!"
S. Lynne Nielsen,5,Love the community experience Bedly offers.
Ron Kingston,5,Bedly is a very professional and reliable realtor in New York!
Emily Fascilla,5,"Bedly streamlined my cross country move in a way I thought only existed in my dreams. NYC is notoriously difficult for renters, especially if you don't live in the area to scope out a place yourself. The photos and 360 degree tour of the apartment was true to reality and no unhappy surprises. Because it came furnished I was able to buy a one way ticket to NYC with my clothes and books and arrive to a beautiful, furnished apartment. Some happy surprises: cleaning services, the laundry onsite, and the complimentary happy hour gatherings with other Bedly renters/prospects. I also love being able to pay online - you can even split up your monthly payments, charge them to a card, or have them come right out of your checking. They're extremely responsive and customer focused. When they say they take the pain out of renting they mean it."
Andrea Erali,5,"Bedly simplified my life when I needed to find a new room. The Bedly website is super easy to navigate, thanks to a clean layout. There are many available rooms, all modern and clean and always in convenient locations. The customer service is always ready to answer any questions, before and after booking a room. Don't waste any more time trying to look for rooms on Craigslist and other websites. Just try out Bedly, even out of curiosity, and you'll see what I'm talking about."
